Show Notes: Birds, which contained a tease of A Love Supreme, was unfinished and 
melted into an atypical jam. Catapult was sung over this jam, which then led to 
Heavy Things. Brad Sands brought out Page's wife, Sofi, to dance with the band 
during Meatstick.

note:
there was a cut on the DAT during the encore break.
I cross-faded the short crowd noise that was there between Velvet Sea and Character Zero to make it seem seamless.
