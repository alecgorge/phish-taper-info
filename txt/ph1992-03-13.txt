Notes: The "?" in the lineage is not an extra analog generation.  I'm just not
sure if the PCM came from a DAT or not, thus I put the question mark in.  I
transferred the PCM, removed the DC offset, converted from 44.056Khz to 
44.1Khz at the highest quality setting, tracked, and burned this show on
July 30, 2003.  I wonder if perhaps the master was recorded with Dolby on and
played back with it off.  It seems a bit too bright to me.  However, I did
not mess with the recording in any way.  Enjoy!

* - There is a very small dropout at 2:10.  I tried several times to get a
clean read off the PCM tape at that spot, but could not.  It's hardly
noticable, though.

^ - Has a vocal jam based on "Hawaii" and a "Lullabye" tease in it.

^^ - "Somewhere Over the Rainbow" tease to start

^^^ - Trey explains secret language

***RE-MASTERING NOTES 8/2003***
This show almost certainly has the pre-emphisis enabled if this a *true* PCM recording. That is the most likely cause for the overly harsh sound of the show. Upon getting these SHN's, they were loaded into REBA and passed through a 20band Parametric EQ with the J17 de-emphisis setting. Next in store for this show was a pass through the BBE Sonic Maximizer. This was used to really bring the mix together....it really brought out the low end very well. You can actually hear Mike's bass now ;-) The reason this was done is because if you listen real closely, you may notice you hear a lot of room dynamics....the recording had a slight time smear problem because of the 2 sources used to record this. The BBE unit was used to correct for this. Yes, you heard me right...I think this is a matrix, SBD+AUD. The SOAM has some nasty feedback. I crossfaded the feedback to "lessen" the damage to our ears. The pops in Fluffhead were toned down somewhat, but I had to leave BBFCFM alone....most of the distortion you hear is not dropouts but rather mic overload.

The show was re-mastered, re-tracked, then shn'd in August 2003.
