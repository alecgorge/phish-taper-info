Thanks to Charlie Dirksen and Kevin Shapiro for the DAT.

When I first received this DAT there was a small amount of DAT static during the Landlady.  I immediately made an analog copy of it onto Maxell XLII-s.  By the time I got a hold of the Marantz CD burner, the DAT static during Landlady had gotten much worse.  So in making the CDR I took the Landlady from the analog 1st gen. copy and the rest of the set directly from the DAT as a digital clone.  Pardon me for any mess ups in tracking, I wasn't always right there to hit the next track button when the songs started.  Enjoy!
