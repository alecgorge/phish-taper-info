The show was loaded onto SLOTH via secure EAC rip with no errors on an NEC1300A DVD+/-RW drive. After being loaded, the show was examined for errors and eidited accodingly. The first set was out of pitch by -40 cents, and this was corrected. There were far too many edits to list...well over 300 edits were done. After editing the dropouts and cuts, the show was then processed at the 32bit word length for best possible precision. Some of the tracks have some nasty static which could not be edited in any way.

Thanks to LawnGirl for the source discs and for keeping me busy working on this one.
