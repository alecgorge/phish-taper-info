Show Notes:

In set I there is some kind of clapping noise during the end of 
Runaway Jim and Stash, After Stash Trey metions they are having 
"Technical Difficulties" and that they are going to fix it during 
Amazing Grace. In set two there was a droupout in the beggining 
of Glide which I edited out.
