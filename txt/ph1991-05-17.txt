Show Notes: A blackout occurred during Chalk Dust. The drum solo and jam that ensued featured 
Carl Gerhard, who also guested on 'A' Train, Magilla, Cavern, and Lawn Boy. The Man Who 
Stepped Into Yesterday was introduced as "The Old Man Who Stepped Into Yesterday." Happy 
Birthday was sung to Page. Bike was played for the first time since November 10, 1990 (64 shows).

Show Notes:

$ w/ Carl "Gears" Gearhard

* Power Outage during Chalkdust Torture. John turned the deck off briefly. 
When the tape deck comes back on, Page, Fishman and Carl Gearhard jam... 
Jam includes portions of the Spiderman TV theme song (killer!).  When the 
power comes back, Trey and Mike join in and finish the Jam.

notes from Weave:
I remember the tapers using their pen lights to light the guys on the 
stage during this jam. John was taping from just in front of the soundboard.
Unfortunately, the air conditioning did not come back on the rest of the 
night. It was litterally the hottest show I was at. It was an unusually warm 
spring day, so it was miserably hot and sticky inside the Campus Club. By 
the end of the show we were all drenched in sweat! (That's why Trey makes
mention of the A/C problem at the end of A-Train).

TMWSIY is introduced as "the old man who stepped into yesterday" for Page, on his birthday.

** Magilla features a Flinstone's Theme jam

NO tracking/editing/alterations performed before archiving to 24-bit FLAC
(except to trim silence from the ends).
