Notes------There are a three places (on the original DAT) that sound like brief 'skips'. There is one at the beginning of Julius (which is barely noticable), and two in Possum (which are very noticable). There is also a fair amount of clipping resulting from the levels being too high on the DAT recording. It is not very noticable, from my repeated listening, except on some vocal parts. All problems noted here were in the source DAT.
