Killer" jam. ##Entire Part I. ###With glowrings, and Trey on keys. ^Followed 
by banter and toying, all continuing an E chord from the end of "Wilson" 
(which was never finished). Trey gabbed about TV, books, and Deep Purple, 
teased "Smoke on the Water," compared it to "Cat Scratch Fever," and more. 
^^Followed by more talking, band introductions, a mention of the fan group 
CK5, and teases of "Miss You" (Rolling Stones). ^^^With fireworks.
