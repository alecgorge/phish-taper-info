notes: 
PYITE has some level adjustments near the beginning, otherwise the rig ran untouched.
In my opinion, this has one of the best Gumbos EVER.  Ghost is pretty slick too.
Don't let the lack of an external AD conv. fool you...this one turned out amazing.  
If only all OTSs had the sound of Van Andel on this night.
