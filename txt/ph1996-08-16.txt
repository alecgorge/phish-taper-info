#Notes#
To cover the first minute of the FM source for SOAM when the radio DJ was making the station announcement, I used the AUD source that was previously used to cover the entire song. I tried to make this transition as easy on the ears as possible, making the change as close to a "dead spot" as possible. The only "glitch" so to speak on this copy was a fast dropout in David Bowie just before the fast triplet notes at the end (approximately @ 10:29.856). Doing a time based edit (based on the time signature) I did the edit to the best of my abilities, and although it is not perfect it is better than hearing the "crunch" of the dropout....Other than that, this is a flawless representation of the concert....
