Phish 12/30/94 Madison Square Garden - New York, NY

Source: 		DAUD/FOB Schoeps mk4(ORTF) > KC5 actives > CMC5 >
		Sonosax SX-M2 > Apogee AD-500e > Sony D10 @48kHz
		Set 1: Master (from D10) used in below transfer
		Set 2: Master > clone(s) (backup) used in below transfer (see below)		

Conversion: 	R500 > Canare Coax > Sek'd Prodif Plus > Soundforge 5.0 
		(fade in/out/edits/48>44.1 at highest setting[4of4]
		with anti-alias filter) > CD Wave > mkwACT v0.97
		(shn files have seek tables appended) **No DAE at all** 		

Detailed info:	This recording was done on a stand in Row M, (aka DFC!).

Minor Edits:	Fades in/out beg/end of sets--3 sec fade-in's and 5 sec fade out's
		Eliot provided two separate versions of set-2; both clones directly 
		from the master--which is not around.  One of the clones has a dropout
		from cloning (weird loss of signal) in Harry Hood (I'll call this clone
		'clone A' as it is used for most of set-2) the other clone ('clone B') 
		has a cut at the beginning of Sample.  Hence, we don't have access to the 
		master anymore and these are the two closest things around.  So, to make 
		a perfect source from these two nearly perfect clones of the master I 
		have used clone A up until right before Harry and there I have patched 
		in clone B for the rest of the show (about 23m23s).  This was done by
		patching the two sources at the sample level in SF 5.0 during the crowd
		noise between HYHU and Harry Hood.  More detailed info is provided in the
		48k .shn's as the timing is pertinent in those files and not here, because
		all the edits were done at 48k prior to resampling.  No music was disturbed
		and the patch is done at the sample level so it's inaudible to the human ear,
		or as close to perfect as it's gonna get.

Setlist from "The Phish Companion" http://www.phish.net/mockingbird
*This show can be fit on two discs (1 74min and 1 80min) by putting Sample and Poor Heart
on d1 and moving the two tracks from d3 on to the end of d2.  Either way d2 needs an 80min.
