Source Notes:
Soundcheck + Set 1 are the new source. 
Something odd going on @ 12:40 of YEM
Cut ~2:07 in Wilson, likely a tape flip on the original source that created this.
Pretty tough cut ~0:28 of David Bowie, likely the second tape flip from the first source. 
Second cut nasty cut in Bowie at tape end
Others have said this first set sounds off-speed. I did not speed adjust this source at all.
Set 2 was originally part of shnid 112453
AC/DC Bag > Possum is of a different, also unknown lineage


SHOW NOTES
This show was a Benefit for VPIRG (Vermont Public Interest Research Group). 
It was not listed in the March or April 1989 Phish newsletters but is believed to have occurred at this time and place. 
During McGrupp, Fish used a brand new electronic drum machine.  
Attendance for this show reportedly suffered due to no alcohol being served.  
This version of Split Open And Melt included a drum solo.
