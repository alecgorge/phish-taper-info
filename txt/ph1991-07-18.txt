Show Notes: This show featured the Giant Country Horns. At one point during the show, 
the crowd was told by the promoter that they were dancing too much, prompting Trey to offer 
a date with Fishman to the fan who danced best on their chair!

*Notes*
Shockra opened. With The Giant Country Horns.

The bouncers/security at The Casino Ballroom are assholes. The worst I have ever seen. The taper and I (weave) were on the guest list for this show. The bouncers at the door insisted we were not on the list. We had to find someone with a ticket to go inside and find John Paluska. Eventually, Paluska came to the door and we got in.

The Casino Ballroom has a policy that everyone must sit down at their table for all shows. And they enforce it with their steroid-crazed bouncers. You can hear them yelling for people to sit down early in the 1st set. More than 1 person got tossed out for standing/dancing. They had a small dance floor to the side of the stage. That was the only place were you could dance. The Casino Ballroom sucks. 

NO tracking/editing/alterations performed before archiving to 24-bit FLAC
(except to trim silence from the ends).
