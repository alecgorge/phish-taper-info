Taped by Dave F.
Transfer from DAT by Kevin Davis
Edited and tracked by Blane Harvey


Edits and Notes*:  Parts of the show were recorded too loud (stealth FOB), and levels were adjusted at the 
beginning First Tube, Horn and Birds.  I've tried to smooth this out as much as possible without making any editing 
noticeable.  Still there is clipping and distortion noticeable at the beginning of First Tube, before the levels are 
dropped and during the crowd screams in Char. Zero. 

The taper ran into some security issues between sets and had to relocate, therefore there are some sound differences 
between sets even though it's from the same rig. The first set was extremely bassy, so I performed a small bass reduction 
using the eq tool in Audition, but it is still quite bassy. Personally, I like it like that.  There is also some sonic 
wierdness during the beginning of Horn. I'm not sure if this was from the PA or the recording, but it's quite short and 
not really something that could be edited.  

Hope you enjoy it!
