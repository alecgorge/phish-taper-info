show notes:
This show was part of the HORDE tour. 

tech notes:
The story behind the analog cassette generation is this:
Shortly after the show, Tim and his brother made a cassette from the original DAT.
Shortly thereafter, the master DAT was lost.  So Tim and his brother made a new DAT 
copy from the master cassette that they had made.  The master cassette back to DAT transfer 
occurred way back in '92, and the master DAT has never been found, so it's very unlikely 
that it will ever surface, and this will be the best that is available from this source.  
Regardless of the cassette generation, the sound on this is very nice.

There was a short drop-out on the DAT towards the start of Cavern.
I used the circulated AKG 460 source to patch in this segment.
The patch source was used from [00:09] to [00:18].
