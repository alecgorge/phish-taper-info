This is from one of the first Phish tapes that ever came into my possession, circa fall 1992 ... transferred from my D6 
to a standalone CD burner circa 2005. There's a little hiss and a bit of tape degradation in some places, but all 
instruments and vocals are very clear and overall it's a pretty nice sounding recording. For some reason, Golgi is 
absent from the beginning of set 2. Presumably there are tape flips in there somewhere, too, but a quick scan 
failed to turn them up. Maybe there's a better soundboard source out there somewhere, but since there's none 
listed in the database, I figured I'd get this one up there, since there seems to be a lot of interest 
in this (classic!) show. Enjoy!
