Notes:  This show was recorded back at the bar so it sounds a little distant and there are a few times where people near the deck were screaming.  You can hear Pete D. and Rob S. by the mics the whole time, but not sure who actually brought a deck, but it was not either of them. There was a 3 second dropout during the slow part of Lizards which was removed and crossfaded.  There were also a number of instances where they stopped and started the tape between a few songs. Also, Possum is cut. Some level fluctuations too.  Certainly not perfect, but a pretty good indication of what it was like to see Phish at this venue.
