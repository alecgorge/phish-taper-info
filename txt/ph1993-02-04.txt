Known Flaws: Set 1, Track 1 (Axilla) cuts in shortly before vocals
start.  I faded in the track to make the abrupt start a little more
tolerable.  In addition, there is substantial level flux and 
minor distortion during the first half of Axilla.  The levels start 
out VERY high and the preamp and/or mics overload.  An attenuator is 
subsequently switched on and the distortion ends.  Record level 
fluctuations are also present as the taper and patcher adjust levels.
