Show Notes: 
- Happy Birthday was sung by "Rocco" to Trey's sister Christine. 
- Possum included Fishing Hole Theme teases. 
- The band asked the audience several times if anyone could give them a ride back to Burlington, as their van broke down on the road to Philadelphia. 
- As with the encore the night before, Trey introduced Fishman as "The King of Prussia."
