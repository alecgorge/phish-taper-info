Show Notes: It's Ice included a tease of I Feel the Earth Move. Trey made several references to the 
venues springy floor and the fans bouncing on it while they dances. This strange Ya Mar included some 
odd lyrics from Mike. Fishman, usually subject to nicknames when he takes the mic, introduced Trey as 
Chuck Norris on the drums. Trey retorted by calling Fish "a butt with protruding arms and legs." 
Antelope was dedicated to three new crew members from Vancouver. 

Baby Gramps opened. 
*With an "I Feel the Earth Move" jam. 
** Not included (Performed w/o mics and therefore inaudible thru the SBD)
