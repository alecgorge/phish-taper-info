Mastering Notes:
The 24/48 FLACs were converted to WAV with Flac v1.1.0 (thanks MikeW) and opened in WaveLab.  The first step was to remove as much of the noise floor as I could with Waves X-Noise.  X-Noise was applied to both files and rendered @ 24/96.  The next step was a 2-band EQ where I rolled off below 40Hz, and boosted the top end @ 4200 2dB with a Q of 0.5.  Then Blue Tubes FA770 Compressor, BBE Sonic Maximizer was next (lo contour set at 3.5, and the top end knob set at 2.5.  Finally, the Blue Tubes .  It was downsampled with the 192KHz Stereo Resampler and rendered at 16-bit.  The 2 sides of the cassette were then rendered into 1 large .WAV file, downsampled with the 192KHz Stereo Resampler and rendered at 16-bit.  Tracking was done with CD-Wav then converted to SHNv3 (seek tables appended).

It's so good, makes you wonder what they played in Set II... ;)
