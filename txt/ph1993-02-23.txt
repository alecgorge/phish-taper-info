Known Flaws:

Whole show is unmodified from the master cassette I received.
Whole show has a myriad of problems that I chose not to resolve. This will have to do until something better surfaces.
Beginning of I am Hydrogen is cut.


Show notes:


Begining of My Friend, My Friend with Trey on acoustic guitar.
Simpsons Signal, All Fall Down signal during Run Like an Antelope
Evil laughing from the band during the Split Open And Melt jam
I Am Hydrogen included the lyrics, "I walk awakening on the misty fields of forever."
First Nellie Kane
Vaccuum solo during Terrapin
Sweet Adeline was performed WITH microphones


Source notes from tallboy:

This show was requested by a friend of mine and has evidently not been circulated.  He had a copy but said it sounded terrible.  He compared to mine and said mine was much better, so for now this is the best copy known to exist.  It is not a great sounding recording by any means, there is some distortion and the taper was messing with the levels here and there.  However, it is a great show from Phish's first Phlorida run and as such at least deserves to be heard by those who are interested.

At this point in Phish's career they were almost unknown in Florida so consequently played small venues on this run which encompassed Tallahassee, Miami, Orlando, Tampa and Gainesville.  The Edge was a very small club.  They played there again 4/30/94.  When they returned in October of that year they had already grown to the point where they had to play on an outdoor stage behind the venue.

No remastering done to this tape by tallboy, taper is unknown.
