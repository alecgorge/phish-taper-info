Show Notes: A golf cart (and Trey's children) made an on-stage appearance during 
Disease. Foam was played for the first time since November 28, 1998 (87 shows). 
A large storm provided thunder and lightning during Gin. Gin also included teases 
of Elton John's Philadelphia Freedom. Antelope featured Tom Marshall on vocals. 
Glide (first since July 24, 1999, or 64 shows) included an All Fall Down Signal. 
Sand included a syncopated jam.
