Show Notes: 
- Divided Sky was botched badly, leading Trey to launch humorously into BBFCFM. 
- First known Dinner and a Movie 
- Mike announces A-Train as Fuck Your Face.
- This was the last known show at Hunt's.

Tech Notes:
- Whipping post was patched with http://db.etree.org/shninfo_detail.php?shnid=29744
- There are cuts and SBD "alterations" over the course of the entire show. These were left as-is.
- These were not the best sounding tapes. No fancy restoration was performed. EQ was run to remove as much of the hiss as possible...
