Show date is not correct, actually this was released in June of 1987. It was a demo recording shopped around to Burlington bars, in hopes of scoring gigs. Part of this were proper studio recordings included on Junta (and omitted here) The rest were undated live tracks: Wilson, Alumni Blues, Lizards, The Sloth, and a STUDIO version of Mikes > H2 > Weekapaug, that is a Junta outtake. 
Very rare, and very cool.
