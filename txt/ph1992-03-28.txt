notes:
- recorded & transfered @ 16/48 and converted to 16/44
- minor level tweeks during t01 (on DAT)
- show was stopped early due to a sewage pipe breaking and filling the floor and first few rows with
   a fecal stew. In fear of being electrocuted Phish performed 4 songs a cappella and said "goodnight"
- small 2nd set (4 songs a cappella) was not recorded due to being way to close to the poopy water!
- t08 and t09 not listed on phish.net and is rare.
