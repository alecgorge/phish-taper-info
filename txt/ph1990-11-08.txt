Show Notes: YEM through the end of the show (both encores) featured John Popper on harmonica; Popper also scat sang during YEM. 

**NOTES**
Disc 1 will burn to an 80 minute disc if you leave track 5 out. Otherwise, yer outta luck...

This show is a rare one....many people have the second set, while the first had eluded us for all this time. The tapes used for the transfer definately had some age to them. This is apparent by the ammount of hiss present. Notice that the high freq's are, for the most part, still audible even through the hiss.....most of the hiss is tape degradation, not generational. There are some real wild volume swings which I tried to even out as best I could given the situation.....Durring the show, from Coil to the middle of YEM, the SBD was drastically lower in volume. I did raise this at the expense of introducing more hiss....this, however, was a trade off I was willing to make.

ENJOY!
