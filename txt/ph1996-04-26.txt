Phish - 4/26/1996 
New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival 
Fairgrounds, New Orleans, LA 

The original DAT had an odd quality to the high frequencies, with 
some occasional noise (wind, perhaps). This was NOT the result 
of the DAT > CDR transfer, which was purely digital. 
In spite ofthe imperfections, this is a rare show of which not many sources 
are available, so I figured I'd spread it.
