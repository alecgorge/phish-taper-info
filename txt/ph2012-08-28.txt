Taper's log: 	
Wasn't sure I would make this show, even though it's in my home town.  After taping my first
shows at Jones Beach and SPAC in July, I thought I might get stuck working away from home.  So
glad the stars aligned in my favor, for this was definitely a show NOT to miss!  Thanks Bill from 
New Orleans for the clamp space.  Thank you Phish!  Enjoy!
