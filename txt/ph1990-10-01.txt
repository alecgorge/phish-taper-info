Notes: Taken from an analog tape with unknown generations. There are a few instances of 
dropouts and tape warble from age, and a little hiss. Overall not bad, and a missing set
that hasn't circulated before. The beginning of Bouncing is clipped due to the tape flip.
I'm not 100% certain if the Lawn Boy and the AC/DC Bag are really the first two songs of
set II or not, or filler, but I left them just in case. Neither song is on the list for Set II which
has been in circulation from some time.
Enjoy!
