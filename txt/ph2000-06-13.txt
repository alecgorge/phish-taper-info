 Thanks to a couple of weary travellers on their way back to the U.S. with a short
stopover here in Toronto, this fine music makes it out nice and quick.
 
 This is the only Apogee source that was running in Japan, though there were 2 or 3 other
Schoeps sources.  It's an amazing recording of a sick show.  Enjoy!

Show Notes: Cavern included the older, alternate lyrics and a drawn-out, feedback-enhanced ending. The 
band teased Is She Really Going Out With Him before Jibboo and after Wolfman's, with the audience 
singing along at one point. The audience tried in vain to coerce Phish to play it in its entirety. 
Antelope was unfinished - Mike segued into a funky version of Contact right before the "Rye, Rye, 
Rocco" lyric segment of Antelope.
