The Green Dolphin Street Demo is a post Bivouac Juan, pre White Tape demo that included some of the same material as the Bivouac Tape.
It came labeled to me exactly as that: Green Dolphin Street Demo 1985.
A few of these songs are earlier mixes of material that ended up on The White Tape.
Since it's precise origin is unknown - I hope nobody objects - expecially since the sound quality is by far inferior to the released version of the
White Tape and there are subtle variations.
It was likely a mix of material recorded on 4-track in NJ with Bivouac and in Burlington VT in 1985.
Any questions regarding this material - feel free to drop a line to me at taperwayne@gmail.com
Enjoy!
