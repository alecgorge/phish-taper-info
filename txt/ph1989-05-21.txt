Notes
*tape flip? at 0:41 in d2t3 Dazed and Confused
**Divided Sky ends abruptly...from original cassette (seems to be a 100 min master)
   (most likely it was the end of the cassette and the remainder of the song 
   was not taped or has been lost)

Fixes
-Each disc was normalized to 98%.
-Retracked both discs so that the start of the song appeared at the start of each track.
-There were a few instances where there was no right channel sound or the right channel 
  would have sound/static for a few seconds, then drop out, then come back in as 
  sound/static. This was fixed by mixing the left channel, which was normal, onto the 
  right channel. Even though this is not PCP-compliant, the tracks were not listenable 
  to during these periods until the fixes were made.
  This occurred...
	0:00-1:30 d1t1 Harry Hood
	8:38-9:21 d2t2 Dazed and Confused
	0:00-1:12 d2t3 The Sloth
-There was some nasty static for about a second at the very beginning of Divided Sky 
  that I did my best to smooth/edit out but it was a lost cause.  I decided to cut 
  out that portion in order to not distract from the rest of the show.  The 
  transition is not noticeable at all.
