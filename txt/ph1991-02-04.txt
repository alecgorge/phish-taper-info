Notes from Tim Brennan:

I got this tape while trading in Colorado in late 90's. Guy I got it from is an
older trader and long gone since. There was no 'part 1' to this tape, and no setlist
on the cover, just the date. Trey mentions the Front so it must be correct.

I recorded the shows as clean as possible back in the day so the tape is what it is.

Additional notes from Tim Brennan:

I received this show on cassette from a friend in Colorado who received it from a phan
touring with the band on spring 93. Not much is known of this show other than it was Cass/3.
