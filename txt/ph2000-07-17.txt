Show Notes: This was a taping for the television show "Austin City Limits." Beauty 
of My Dreams was botched and restarted. Due to technical difficulties, First Tube 
was played a second time. After Piper, Trey responded to some fan requests and noted 
that the band saw Bela Fleck tape a performance for "Austin City Limits" in 1993. 
When the Circus Comes was dedicated to Los Lobos. The episode was set to debut on 
October 14, 2000, to kick of the show's 26th season.
