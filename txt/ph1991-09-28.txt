SHOW NOTES: "Before Llama, an award was presented for 
longest distance traveled for any Phish gig to Henry Petras, who traveled to Amy's 
Farm from Palo Alto, California. During Weekapaug, Trey soloed while riding through the
crowd on rollerblades. BBFCFM featured "I Love Lucy" theme teases, and Antelope featured
an early Simpsons Signal. After Brother, Trey wished a happy birthday to "Dmitri." Eliza 
was played for the first time since November 24, 1990 (82 shows)." - couresy of the 
Phish Companion.

***NOTES***
Had to re-shn this show. There was extra header info on every file, which was stripped using shntool. The Sets were reconstructed, then severe sound processing was performed to try to balance the mix out a little better. The bottom end of Mike and Fish was boosted, using my UltraLowExtender (still in development stages)....Also, the balance of the recording was a whole 20 degrees off center axis. This was corrected in the transfer stage by adjusting the mixer to center the soundstage. The show was retracked to two discs. Final mix measurements performed on the files using REBA before sending the files through my finalizer for re-shn'ing and burning.
