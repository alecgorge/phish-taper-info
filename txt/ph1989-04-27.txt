Show Notes: 

String Changing Nature was not really a song, but rather a jam that 
arose while the band tuned their instruments and included some funny stage banter. 
Whipping Post was well-jammed and Sanity was the fast version.
There was a tape flip in the middle Lizards, Crowd noise was cut between second set and 
encore, Whipping Post Fades out.
