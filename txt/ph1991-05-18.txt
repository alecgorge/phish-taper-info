Show Notes: The Bowie intro included Trey teasing 'A' Train. Before Foam, Trey noted that this gig 
would be the last until July since the band was going into the studio to cut an album. 
Terrapin featured a brilliant vacuum solo. Before Dinner and a Movie, Fishman noted that 
"this is a song about America's favorite pre-nuptial ritual."

Tech Note:
-Tape flip between Foam and Divided Sky was crossfaded. Minimal music is missing from the start of Sky.
-There is substantial mic overload on the right channel throughout the course of the show.
