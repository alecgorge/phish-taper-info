Notes: If you are a fan of sound quality, you may want to pass this one over - there is a fair amount of tape hiss and it's taken from an analog of
unknown generations. And it's 1986.
That said if you a phan of history, you'll want to stay tuned. 
This has not circulated in a lossless format before, and it's the best copy I could locate. Consider it a gap filler until an upgrade surfaces.
First off, it's the final circulating gig with Jeff Holdsworth, and one of very few examples of Phish as a 5 man band.
Earth Day at UVM. The gig was likely performed outdoors.
Trey's dad opens the show playing and singing, possibly just a soundcheck, or possibly the tail end of an opening set.
There was deck pausing done between almost all of the songs - but the jams seem to be intact. I notated the tape cuts.
The jam at the end of Alumni had an abrupt cut - so I opted for a fade out.
