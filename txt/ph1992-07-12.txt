Show Notes: This show was part of the HORDE tour. Unlike other HORDE shows, though, 
Phish headlined. The band took the stage wearing papier mache costume masks, which they 
threw into the crowd after Adeline. Glide was dedicated to David Ullrich, a fan who had 
recently died of leukemia. Possum featured the secret language, including the Simpsons, 
All Fall Down, and Oom Pa Pa Signals.
