Show Notes: Rocky Top through Antelope featured the Reverend Jeff Mosier on banjo; Antelope also featured Oteil Burbridge on bass. This show features one of the most humorous moments ever caught on tape! It started when the crowd chanted for Fee as Fishman took the stage during HYHU. Fish sounded perplexed, and remarked that he doesn't sing Fee, but Trey and Page started the song up anyway and left Fishman on the spot. He tried his best and got through the first verse before falling apart during the chorus.

*note*
There is some distortion on the set...it starts durring the fishman part and continues to the end. I lowered the volume to lessen the crackle, but it's still distorted. This is pretty much for historical purposes only...and it is pretty darn funny to boot!
