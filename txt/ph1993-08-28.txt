Show Notes: Crimes featured the Dude of Life on vocals. Antelope included Brady Bunch 
theme teases and a Simpsons Signal, while It's Ice featured Random Note, All Fall Down, 
and Oom Pa Pa Signals. Amazing Grace was performed without microphones. Also, while 
several versions of YEM have teased Oye Como Va, this version featured an all-out jam 
of the song. Contact segued out of the YEM vocal jam. During Daniel, the band introduced 
and thanked each member of the crew.

**Mastering Notes**
The DAT was running flat. This was corrected in wavelab using the Time Stretch feature of the Audio Montage with http://db.etree.org/shninfo_detail.php?shnid=1472 used as the tuning reference. That same source was used to patch the cassette flips after Fluffhead, the end of the Big Ball Jam, and the encores.
