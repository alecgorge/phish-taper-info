Show Notes: This was a radio set that was broadcast on the "Mark and Brian" Radio 
Show. Funky Bitch and My Soul were performed as a warmup before the show went on 
the air, although the crowd was already in the bar. Jibboo through Heavy Things 
were aired live on the show (except for Magilla, which was played during a 
commercial break). The band briefly jammed on the Jeopardy theme tease during a 
radio break after Jibboo, with the crowd providing some vocals. Bug included a 
brief DEG tease. During one commercial break, the fans in attendance were entertained 
with a humorous question and answer session with the band. Studio versions of Birds, 
Bouncing, and Heavy Things were used as intros and outros for the commercials.
