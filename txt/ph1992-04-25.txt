@Levels (on analog tape) start hot and first 5 seconds distorted badly
#tape flip is the first cut, second cut was an 11 second mystery gap five seconds after the music started on Side B
*Langauge (3 "aw fuck" signals)
^Evil Ways (Santana) jam
+Sprockets and Chariots Of Fire theme in vocal jam

There is some distortion at points in this tape. I noticed it the most in Reba and Harry. Not sure what the cause of it is. The same distortion is on the analog tapes, which are peaking at +3, so your guess is as good as mine.

**Mastering**
The show was running slow/flat. This was corrected in Wavelab by shrinking the file to 94.5% of its original size. The sets were then re-tracked, and FLAC'd.
