Notes: -Fantastic sound quality with no noticeable hiss in set 1!!!-I received this show as Cass/0 for both sets but after comparing the hiss levels,   it is apparent that set 2 has gone through more cassette gens than Set 1.  After   referencing the Phish SBD's in Circulation list, which lists set 2 as Cass/x, I have   notated the show as the same.-There is some background noise in set 1 seemingly due to another band playing (mostly   in right channel of mix and most noticeable between tracks and during d1t10).-Tape flip d1t08 15:07 (46:46)-Volume drop in d2t04 0:05-0:11 right channel only-Muffled sound in d2t05 5:44-6:00-In Set 2, the right channel is lower than the left but I left that alone to avoid   having a higher hiss level in the right.-Set 2 is incomplete, but the rest of the songs are unknown.Fixes:-Removed 'thump' in R channel in d1t09 4:55 (0.105 sec) by replacing R channel   with L channel-In set 2, performed Cool Edit hiss reduction based on noise floor sample in d2t03   with a hiss reduction factor of 6.5 dB
