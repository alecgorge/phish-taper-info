*Notes*
- Between Rift and Sample, there was a tape flip that was patched with an AUD source.
- Between Coil and the BBJ, there was a tape flip that was patched with an AUD source. Most of the BBJ   is from the AUD source.
- The end of Paul & Silas and the start of Mike's were cut on the SBD. These were patched with and AUD   source.
- The encore is from an AUD source.
_ Light distortion from analog durring set 2, not very bothersome.
