Notes:
- Oye Como Va tease by Trey in Twist
- Melt the Guns quotes from Fish in Bowie
- Dave's Energy Guide tease in Light
- This was a 3 set show due to the night before being cut short due to severe thunder storms.
- Mic stand was lowered approximately 1' at the beginning of Golden Age through the remainder of set II to shelter them from the rain. 
Rain drops can be heard in spots during this period.
