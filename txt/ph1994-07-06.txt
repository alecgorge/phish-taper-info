SET I

Taped by Pierre Perault
Analog>Dat/Dat>SHN by Blane Harvey

Fixed:
Patch at 14:14 of Reba (tape was flipped right after the music stopped). Patched ~20 seconds
of crowd noise from the shoddy mp3 source that has circulated lightly for this set, just to
maintain the flow of the song.

Known Flaws:
Level adjustments and mic attenuator switch before Carolina on master analog tape.  I didn't
make any changes to these adjustments on the SHN file.
