Show Notes: The jam out of Fluffhead was over fifteen minutes long. Trey and Mike sang Catapult 
in harmony over the top of Tweezer. Alumni was played for the first time since April 15, 1994 
(426 shows, although it was jammed on December 3, 1994 and played in its entirety once on Trey's 
1999 solo tour). Also, Glide was played for the first time since July 29, 1998 (60 shows) and Camel 
Walk was played for the first time since July 28, 1998 (61 shows). The Happy Whip and Dung Song
