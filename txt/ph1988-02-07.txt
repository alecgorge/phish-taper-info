Show Notes:
- Mockingbird made its debut at this show and was played without Forbin's.

Tech Notes:
- All tape flips/pauses in set 1 were patched with http://db.etree.org/shninfo_detail.php?shnid=2602 which was manually pitch corrected to match the Josh Porter source. The only pause that couldn't be corrected is noted.
- The tape flip/pauses in sets 2 and 3 are only missing crowd noise. The ones that needed attention and could be fixed were.
- Set 3 cuts out about 2/3 of the way through Good Times Bad Times. This was patched with a Cass/x provided by Todd Ahrens.
