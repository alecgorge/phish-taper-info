Show Notes: 
- Glide was preceded by an All Fall Down Signal. 
- Tweezer featured Colonel Bruce Hampton on trombone. 
- YEM included a Me and My Arrow Signal, a Dave's Energy Guide tease, and a Welcome Christmas tease in the vocal jam.
- Tape flips between Reba/Uncle Pen and YEM/The Horse. Vocal Jam is cut short, and beginning of The Horse is cut. These are crossfaded as best as possible.
- Cut in Antelope at the Marco Esquandolis section.
- Carolina is missing from this source.
