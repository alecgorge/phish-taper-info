Show Notes: There was a Roundabout tease before Ginseng Sullivan. Antelope featured 
Tom Marshall on vocals. The band put on wet suits during the end of the YEM vocal jam. 
The third set was preceded by bubble noises through the PA and the band "diving" into the 
aquarium on stage. Peaches en Regalia was teased in many songs, including Possum and 
Suzy Greenberg, and Auld Lang Syne was teased in Harry Hood.
 
* With Tom Marshall on vocals.

# Performed early so Mike could use the footage to make the video. This 
wasn't really an official debut of "Down With Disease"; the song was not
played. 04-04-94 Burlington <1994.html> is the real debut.
