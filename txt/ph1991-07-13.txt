**Mastering**

+ On the master the levels jump from 00:20:59-> 00:21:50 in Divided Sky. Distortion results.
+ There is a cut at the start of If I Only Had a Brain...almost like the taper paused to save room.
+ All the indicated tape flips and cuts have been either faded or crossfaded.
**24/48 Masters do exist at the unedited/pre-processed level**

Show Notes: This show featured The Giant Country Horns from Suzy through the end of the 
first set and from Guelah through the encore. Trey flubbed the slow, middle section of Divided 
Sky and humorously remarked that "that was the jazz version." Brain was preceded by Happy 
Birthday teases and was dedicated to Erica; YEM subsequently included a brief reprise of 
the tease from Trey. The YEM vocal jam featured Chain Gang teases from Mike.
