Remaster by Steve Shelton- Digital Buddhas Productions, Detroit, MI

This is the complete Wendell Studio sessions digitally remastered to remove excessive hissing. No equalization was done. Waves 5.0 X-Noise was used to strip undesirable noise, and Waves 5.0 L3 Ultra Maximizer was used to correct the decibel level after the noise was removed to ensure proper decibel levels. Any questions or comments, email me @ steve@digitalbuddhas.org

From the Pharmer's Almanac Vol. 6:
"Recorded in the summer of 1990 at Wendell Studios in Boston, MA.  The band entered the studio soon after
the June 16, 1990 Townshend Family Park show, but elected not to release any of the recorded material.
Tapes of the sessions circulate lightly among fansl the first tape is more difficult to track down than
the second"

Much thanks to Sarah and Wayne for the discs!
Enjoy the music.  Peace~ Bill DiPalma (DiPalma81@comcast.net)
