Set I Source: SBD > cass/?  >Audacity 1.2.4 > FLAC16
Transfer: By Taperwayne

Notes: I had this material as filler on an analog of another show.
The sourced version of this show is far superior in sound quality than
this source - however these tracks are missing from Set I, so I decided to
archive them.

Set II Source: MCS > Dat > CD
Encoding: CD > EAC (secure Mode) > WAV > SHNTool > Flac (1.1.0)
