notes:
The original DAT recording was made with pre-emphasis.
The Waves Q10 Paragraphic EQ (v5.0) plug-in was used to de-emphasize the recording.
The original 48 kHz .wav files from the DAT transfer have been archived, and are available upon request.
Big thanks to Eliot Byron for letting me borrow his DAT tape!

notes:
the beginning of MINU is muffled, as the taper is still getting his gear ready.
everything gets worked out around [00:47], and the rest of the show sound great.
there was a cut in the encore break.
I cross-faded the two sides of the cut to make it smoother.
