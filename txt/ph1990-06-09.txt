* - Phish came out onto the stage for the second set and the D.J. was still playing music out into the house speakers-the tune was Led Zep Whole Lotta Love. As a means to warm up a lil', Phish started playing along with the record playing in the house speakers. The D.J. noticed they were on stage and faded out the Led Zep leaving Phish alone playing Whole Lotta Love-that jam ends and they go directly into Harry Hood.
