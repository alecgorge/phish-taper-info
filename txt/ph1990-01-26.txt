SBD Cass/2 (Maxell XLII-S 90 min)> Sony TC-WE805S >
Art DI/O (48Khz, Input gain +~14dB, No "Tube Warmth")>
Delta DIO 2496> WaveLab v4.0c> WAV (@24/48)> FLAC (archived) > Mastering > SHNv3

Mastering Notes:
The FLAC24's were converted to .WAV with FLACv1.1.0 and opened in Wavelab.  I used X-Noise on both files and rendered both files at 24/48.  I re-opened both files in the Montage window, performed a fade at the start of Antelope and at the end of Esther and performed the following mastering processes: Waves REQ (rolloff @ 40Hz), Blue Tubes FA770, BBE Sonic Maximizer (lo contour at a notch about 3, process just below 2), Blue Tubes LM2S.  The .WAV was downsampled with the 192KHz Stereo Resampler and rendered at 16-bits.  Tracking was done in CD-WAV, and the files were converted to SHNv3 (seek tables appended).
