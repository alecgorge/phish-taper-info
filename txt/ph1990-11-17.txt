Notes

Fantastic sounding AUD - the Nak 300s strike again.  A small crossfade covers a dropout in Llama.  Tape flip in audience cheering at the end of YEM ? does not interrupt the music.  Another tape flip in audience cheering at the end of Esther ? again, does not interrupt the music.  Props to John for the killer tapeflips!

"Low Rider" jams appear in Suzy Greenberg and the David Bowie intro.  During the HYHU intro for Fishman, Trey introduces Fish as "the hardest man in show buisness, Chris Lee".

NO tracking/editing/alterations performed before archiving to 24-bit FLAC
(except to trim silence from the ends).
