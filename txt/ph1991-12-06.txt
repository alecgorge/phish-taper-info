Notes: The crowd was really bad this evening. Lots of drunk college kids just being real pricks.
When they went to play 'Possum, someone threw a bottle onstage prompting the band to play the
same musical phrase over and over and over while saying "Wait." This lasted nearly 8 minutes. It 
was brilliant.
