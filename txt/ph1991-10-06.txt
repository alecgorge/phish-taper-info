Show Notes: 
Check out this second set for some great stage banter from Fishman. "I hate this fucking song!" he shouted during the lengthy HYHU intro to Terrapin. "All I have do in this band is say I hate something," he commented, "and it'll be done forever." Trey proceeded to tell the crowd that HYHU is the Henrietta theme precisely because Fish hates it. "It used to be 'La Bamba,'" he noted, prompting Page to play the La Bamba riff. After the song, an unamused Fish complained that "they just do it out of HATE." Brother was dedicated to "the guy who offered us $10,000 to play a different song," according to Trey. Adeline was sung from the balcony to open the encore.
