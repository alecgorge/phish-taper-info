notes:
The master DAT was used in this transfer, thanks Dave!
The original DAT recording was made with pre-emphasis. The Waves 5.0 Paragraphic EQ plug-in was used to de-emphasize the recording.
The 48 kHz .wav files from the DAT transfer have been archived, and are available upon request.

Set II
Source: 	SBD/mix > DAT@44.1k (see source notes below)		Set 2: clone no more than 3-4 clones from the master used in below transfer		Source Notes:	More than likely preFM that never aired, as WBCN usually		aired one night of the Great Woods or NYE shows every year and it seems as if		the mix (SBD/aud) matrix was done at the show--check the last track for instance		of the aud feed still going while the SBD feed is played back over it 		(Nellie Kane).	I personally think this assumption makes much more sense than 		the previous assumption that it's the ALO mix as it doesn't sound like it 		(compare for yourself).		Conversion: 	Fostex D5 > Monster Optical > Sek'd Prodif Plus > 		Samplitude v5.5 > Soundforge 4.0 (fades, no resample) > 		CD Wave > mkwACT v0.97		(shn files have seek tables appended)		**No DAE at all** 						Minor Edits:	Fades (in/out at beg/end of set, 3&5 sec respectively)		Removed/smoothed diginoise*** in Sample at 2.58/4.24, clean clones don't circ,		***I tried to do this, but couldn't make it much better, try if you like***DAT for this transfer supplied by Mark Lynn.

show notes:
The first set included the complete Gamehendge saga, including narration between songs.
This version of Stash appears on the Elektra release, A Live One.

recording notes:
The quick fade at the start of Set II was on the DAT.  Dave ran one 3-hour tape for this show, 
and it was getting pretty close at the end.  Dave stopped the deck during the encore break, which is why 
there really is no "encore break" to speak of.  There was some very slight digi-noise where Dave 
stopped/started the deck, and I removed that small portion in WaveLab.
