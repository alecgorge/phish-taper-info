DAT transfer, track splits, and shortening by Mike Masse <mail@mikemasse.com>Sounds great Except for D3 t7 (Old Home Place) and 8 (amazing Grace) are muted due to accapella. These are pretty much indistinguishable here and prolly better left off or edited. This show is from DanG at Dylan and his copy is the same.Todd Nathan (junta.etree.org)
