Show Notes: The Moma Dance included Funky Bitch teases and Tweezer included Funk 49 teases. Trey 
attempted to sing Meatstick in Japanese but wound up flubbing the words. Bouncing included a brief 
outro solo from Trey, which replaced the usual closing guitar lick. This show was re-broadcast on 
Japanese television.
