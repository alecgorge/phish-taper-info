**Edits**
All the tracks from the EAC rip had small gaps. These were seamlessly put back together. The cut between Dog Log and Buried Alive was crossfaded as best as possible. Possum cuts in the middle, and this was faded to end the disc. I'm going to make an educated guess and say this has an analog generation or two because of the hiss and because of the cut in set 2...perfect place for a tape flip if you ask me.
