Show Notes: This show marked the debut of Bathtub Gin. Nancy Taube provided guest vocals on Halley's Comet. Bowie was announced as, dedicated to, and sung as "Lazy Lester." This show also included some rarities, such as the fast version of Sanity, The Practical Song, and a strange ending to The Sloth. Trey compared Antelope to his life-long dream of playing hockey and dedicated the song to "all you pro hockey players out there." The first set ended with yet another great early YEM.

**NOTE**
I kinda messed this up a bit...but upon furthur review it doesn't merit fixing....The End of Curtis Loew fades out, and the Possum abruptly starts, has a cut, then continues. In hindsight, I probably shouldn't have added the fade to Curtis, but there is a flip there anyways....so it's a half-crossfade.
