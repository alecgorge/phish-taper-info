Setlist:
The "Tower Jam"

Notes:
The Tower Jam was an all-improvised (and unannounced, though heavily rumored) set 
from the roof of the old air-traffic control tower, taking place about 2-3am, 
with special lighting by Chris Kuroda.
Featured many teases, accompanied by dancers on rappel lines down the tower's sides.

I've left this tracked as it should be, as one track clocking in at 1:00:25...enjoy!!
