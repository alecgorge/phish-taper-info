NOTES:
- Due to the nature of FM-sourced SBDs and DAT tapes there are some small anomolies throughout.  
If your FLACs verify, it's probably on the master copy I made.  Sorry.

- The first 12 minutes or so of Set 1 had many flaws and was replaced with one of the circulating FOB AUD sources.

- There was sporadic digital noise in Bathtub Gin after the patch point, some of which was "fixed" 
when I created small dropouts.  I felt the dropouts sounded better than a patch with the FOB and 
obviously better than the digital noise/interference.
