I found two ways to not have the encore on a solo disc, use an 80 minute disc for CD 2 and the encore or fit the encore of this show onto CD 3 of 12.4.99. If you have any comments, good or bad, email me. Don't say my stuff sucks or kicks ass without letting me know too. My email is supplicationjam@hotmail.com. Peace.
