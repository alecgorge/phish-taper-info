Notes: Used Hiss Reduction in Cool Edit 2K to remove major
hiss from this cassette source, after that it sound pretty good.
Another classic old school Phish show.
Supposedly only two people were in attendance. * includes
yelling of "Pennsylvania Rhode Island!"  ** Different, jammed-
out intro. # Preceded by Trey saying, "Penn State, We Love You"; with different structure and lyrics (see 06-20-88)
