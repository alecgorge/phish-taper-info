Source:
Unknown,First set probably a great fob schoeps, i do know there is an fob schoeps source going around. Second set is definately DSDB. The first 4 seconds of suzie is cut, amazing grace is on the setlist, but cant be heard because it was sang without mics. Therefore making me further believe that the second set is soundboard. Thanks to CASH MCCALL for the dats.
