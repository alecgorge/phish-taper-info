Tech Notes:
- How High the Moon is cut. Unknown how much music is missing.
- 2 dropouts/pauses in Hydrogen, these were left as-is.

NOTE:
This is pretty much for historical record only. The sources used for this offering leave much to be desired. There is a good ammount of hiss present on both sources, and one is MUCH cleaner than the other. No sound alterations were made to these transfers other than volume adjustments to balance them out as best as possible. What you hear is what you get....
