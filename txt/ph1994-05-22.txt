The Vogue, Vancouver British Columbia


Set I:

Welcome to my masterclone copy of this show.
*There is a very split second slight digi noise
on Disc 1 Track 4(Glide).It is so slight and so
quick,and this is such a hot show,I will go
ahead and seed it.

This show was taped by my friend,
Robert Ward from San Jose CA
*While taping this show,Robert adjusted his
levels during the Acoustic Songs so they are
a little "up and down",but it pays off!!
Here's his setup:
NAK 300 Omnis>D-7>DAT.

I have no clue how he mastercloned it for me.

Their journey to SHN:
Technics SV 260A>COAX>WAV>CDWAV>SHN
I have used the MKW audio compression tool.
These SHN files are seekable in your SHNamp.
Also, I have included the md5 for the wav files.
Please use it to verify yours.
Please se the audio file provided
when trading in the audio format.
