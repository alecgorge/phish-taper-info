Notes: Traded off sets with Blues Traveler.
       Set II has some minor distortion issues that were on the original tapes, which I didn't
       make any efforts to correct. They start happening right around when Popper comes
       up to play harp on Funky Bitch. As you can hear from the banter, Paul did a mic
       adjustment so Popper could play and the distortion creeps in at this point.
       It just sounds like something is too "hot" in the mix.  Do not let it deter
       you from grabbing the show however. It's minor and only mildly annoying.
       Any questions, feel free to email me.
       Enjoy!
