* Begins with Fish on the hi-hats for about 25 seconds; Trey then teases Tweezer, 
  Mike starts playing the Tweezer bassline, even Fish changes the beat to match -- 
  and then 57 seconds into the track, it's Bowie! 

** First time played. With different, peppy, upbeat music.

^ Segue not listed in the HPB, but I definitely hear it.

Fixes (Ben):
-My supposedly Cass/0 source was too slow so I applied a +75 pitch 
  shift w/ anti-alias filtering (matched track lengths to verify shift length)
-In d1t06, spliced in other source from 5:07.475-5:09.820 to remove digiglitch
-In d1t08, spliced in other source from 4:55.749-4:57.719 to remove dropout 
-In d2t06, spliced in other source from 10:36.083-10:37.719 to remove diginoise
