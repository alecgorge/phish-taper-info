NOTE:
short static sound during YEM at 12:10.  This was on the DAT, and is not from the transfer.
I had patched this short static segment with the circulating (FOB) B&K 4011 source.  However,
I decided that the change in sound due to the different recording interuppted the "flow" of
the music more than the inital static sound that I was replacing.  Because of this, I decided
to keep it as-is, and you will hear the minor static that I'm talking about.
