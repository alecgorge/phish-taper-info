Additional Editing 4/6/04 by Brandon Johnston: There was a very small dropout at 0:58.321 
of AC/DC Bag that I removed in soundforge. There was also some static on the left channel 
at 1:10.8 of Maze that I fixed by pasting the right channel over the left channel. Also, 
on the original shnset, a portion of the last song was missing. I decided to patch in the 
entire encore from my dat which is apparently from the same source. I decided to crossfade 
in my source during the crowd noise between set II and the encore rather than just patch 
the end of the song due to differing sound levels between my dat and the existing shnset 
and the difficulty that I had making a midsong swich sound smooth (not to mention 
difficulty matching the levels due to the original shnset being 'louder' during loud parts 
yet 'softer' during soft parts) . In the end I preferred a somewhat awkward change in level 
during a period of crowd noise rather than during the middle of a song, as well as a more 
consistant microphone level during the encore, although you may have to turn up the volume 
to hear it due to no amplification on stage. Shntool was also run on each set to fix SBE's.
