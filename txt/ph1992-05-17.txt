Notes: 
- There is a drop around the 45 minute mark of each set, causing the beginning of Stash and Sanity to be clipped.
  This leads me to believe that this was from an analog master or perhaps an analog higher up in the chain caused these
- There was a gap at the beginning of I didn't know, Chalkdust, and Harry Hood but there was overlapping music on 
  both sides. I seamlessly edited these using Soundforge 4.5
- There was a second gap at the beginning of I didn't know that could not be fixed because no overlapping music 
  existed.
