Show Notes: NO2 was played for the first time since July 16, 1994 (355 shows) and, 
for the first known time, included the instrumental ending originally included on The 
White Tape. Reba was unfinished and dissolved into Carini. Antelope included Meatstick 
teases and Trey welcoming his friends Dave and Luann Abrahams. Scott Murawski, guitarist 
for Max Creek, joined the band on Possum and the debut of Tuesday's Gone.
