big thanks to John Stewart for tracking down this tape and sending it to me to transfer
seeded November 3, 2007

recording notes:
The 3rd gen. analog tape that was used in this transfer has a fair amount of distortion.
It's certainly not the best recording, but at this point, its all we have from this show.

Digital Signal Processing (DSP) included:
pitch correction (+1 semitone) to compensate for noticeably slow/flat analog generations/transfers
+12dB for first minute or so of "Golgi", this short portion was recorded at a lower level
normalize each channel seperately to 0dB to balance levels in each channel
(on the cassette, the left channel was approximately 3dB lower than the right)
fades
Waves X-Noise plug-in for hiss/noise reduction
ReSampler 192kHz plug-in to resample to 44.1 kHz
Apogee uv22hr dither to 16 bit

these 16 bit, 44.1 kHz files are ready to be burned to audio CD
the raw, unedited 24 bit, 96 kHz files have been archived and are available upon request
