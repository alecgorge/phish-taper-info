The tracking on this is incorrect to the setlist. I aquired this tape
from Matt Mills a few years back. He brought this show to me with an 
incorrect date. After he researched the setlist he realized that this 
show was not to be found anywhere threw  what resources we had. So 
he asked me to help him place this show and venue. After much research
we now still have no answers. We do know one thing. Trey makes a quote 
that is was only the second time they have played Reba. So with that 
we can place this show in the fall of 89. If anyone has any more info 
on these tapes or what this show might be please contact me. 
Enjoy!!!
