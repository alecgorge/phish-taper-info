Show Notes:
Vacuum solo during No Good Trying
Contact seems to have been played by request.

Known Flaws:

This tape has channel issues and seems very bassy but overall is still listenable until another source appears.
The second half of HYHU is cut.
There was a faded tape flip @ around 8:50 in YEM, I combined the tracks in Adobe Audition 3.0 without automatic crossfading.
Two dropouts in the second half of YEM
