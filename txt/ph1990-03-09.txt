*NOTES*
The first set was recorded a little hot and was clipped on the cass used for the transfer. I lowered the volume of the set to try and soften the overdriven sound....Set 2 was much cleaner, but still had some unfixable flaws. Most notable are a few dropouts in You Enjoy Myself. On a personal note....this show is SICK.
