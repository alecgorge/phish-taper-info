**Editing**
The show was Time Stretched to 92.573% of the original size to correct the pitch and playing time using Wavelab 5.01a at 32bits then dithered back to 16 via the Waves L3 UltraMaximizer. The cut at the end of YEM was faded out.

**NOTES**
This is a dual channel mono recording. I decided to just leave it as is for now...anyone wanting a stereo mixdown of this show, please feel free to contact me at the addy below.
