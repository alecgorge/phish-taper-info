Show Notes: BBFCFM included a Divided Sky tease and Possum included a Tequila tease. 
Bowie included Random Note and Simpsons Signals. I Didn't Know featured Fishman on 
washboard. After the introductory HYHU, while Fish tried to figure out which song he 
would sing, Trey congratulated a fan who sunk two "baskets" during the BBJ. The band 
responded with a brief tease of Rock and Roll Part Two before Fish cued up Love You.

Notes: There was diginoise in Foam @ ~ 2:17  and Runaway Jim @ ~ 2:44 that were smoothed over with Soundforge
       There was a very, very minor static blip in Bowie @ ~ (?2:00) that was eliminated with Soundforge
