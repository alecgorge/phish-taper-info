Taped and Transferred (from DAT master)by David Schall. THANKS DAVID!

"Master" discs (ie. burned by David) extracted using EAC in secure mode with write caching 
disabled, verified with SHNTool, then converted to SHN using MKW 0.97 with seek tables appended, 
by Blane Harvey.

Fixes: Replaced first 3:09 mins of Down With Disease (with 5 second crossfade) from a secondary 
FM source because of some reception problems on David's masters.

This is a killer source of a killer show. ENJOY!!!
