-my notes:
        this is the easiest and only way i figured out how to transfer this show w/o 
any cuts in segues. i don't use 80min cd's, but i'm almost certain it doesn't fit any 
nicer on them.  4 discs are necessary.  bbfcfm will fit on disc four if you want to 
keep the cohesion of one full set on a disc.
 
-notes from HPB:
        This tape has been circulating as 08-27-87 for years due to a handwriting 
error on the master.  Also, a song ("Love on the Telephone) frequently follows 
this show on tape, but it is filler of a band called "Of the Cuff." 
*Without "Poster Nutbag" and dog story.
 
Enjoy!!!
