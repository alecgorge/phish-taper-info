*NOTES*
The first set has some distortion because of the levels being too loud. There was no way to correct this or else I would have. 

Most setlists have Donna Lee as the second song, it's not....

I faded the end of the seond set before the encore as there was a pause. There was no music lost.

Thanks to Alec Swenson for the EAC rip!
