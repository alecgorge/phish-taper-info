Notes:
* abrupt cut after Llama, gap removed.
** tape fip occurs during Divided Sky, little, if any music lost.  Fades were
already present on this tape.  Volume increases slightly after tape flip.
*** tape flip at the end of Coil, little, if any music lost. Fades were 
already present on this tape.
# it's possible that a good portion of the first part of Terrapin is missing.

Fonky1 tells me that there were only two tapers at this show, nothing is
known about the recording equipment.  This circulates very lightly.
