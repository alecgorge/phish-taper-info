Show Notes: Special guests were abound in the second set. Hood included Ronnie McCoury 
on mandolin and Sam Bush on fiddle. I'm Blue I'm Lonesome (first since July 18, 1999, 
or 60 shows), Coming Home, Uncle Pen, and Freebird (first since December 29, 1998, 
or 76 shows) also included Del McCoury on guitar, Ricky Skaggs on mandolin, 
Mike Budd, and Jason Center, along with an upright bass player and a fiddle player 
(both unnamed) in addition to those already on stage. Finally, Freebird was played 
in a full-band arrangement as opposed to the usual a cappella arrangement, with 
Wynonna Judd on lead vocals. Wolfman's included an Inna-Gadda-Da-Vida tease.
