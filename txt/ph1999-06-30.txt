Show Notes: This was the first show in the new stage setup. Maze included Gin teases. Back on the 
Train, Bug, and My Left Toe made their Phish debuts, although Trey played them on his May, 1999, solo 
tour. Also, Bug had been played by Amfibian since they debuted the song on November 4, 1998, albeit 
with slightly different lyrics. Swept Away and Steep were played for the first time since June 30, 1998 (62 shows).

Additional notes about this source:
Mark Nutter kindly allowed Scott to run this rig throughout the Summer tour. 
A 15ft digital line from Scott's PDR1000 was connected to a digital patchbay 
from which a great many tapes were recorded, including some of the previously 
circulating sources. After the tour, all of the master DATs were cloned for 
Mark Nutter. Subsequent clones from Mark Nutter's copies have also been seeded 
over the years. This series is the first transfer of the master dats at the head 
of this chain.

Thanks to Mark for the gear. Thanks to Scott for running it and 
thanks again to Scott for lending me the masters to transfer.

Enjoy.
