First the files were constructed back into full sets. The / and \ indicates a place where there was a tape flip while this was in the analog realm. The flips in the first set were not missing any music, so the crowd noise was crossfaded. The flip in the second set does cut the start of Chalkdust. This cut was crossfaded, avoiding as much musical loss as possible without a jarring transition. 

The show was off pitch and sped up. This was corrected in wavelab using the Time Stretch feature (High Quality, Pitch corrected, Audio was not set to quantize) before the actual sound processing began:

Waves Q10 Input= -3db, HF Shelf +4db @ 1000Hz/Q=7, Output= -4db > Waves RBass +1db @ 50Hz > BBE 0/1.5/0 > Waves L3 MultiMaximizer 16bit/Type 1/Normal
