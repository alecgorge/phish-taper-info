Each CD was extracted as one long file. These files were mastered, and re-tracked in Wavelab 5.01a

^ There is a loud burst that eminates from the SBD at the start.
^^ slight moment of static (maybe 1 second long...tops)

**Notes about the second set:
The second set was riddled with dropouts all over the place...many of the dropouts weren't missing any material once they were removed. Some, however, did produce slight gaps in the music...ever so brief, but still audible...So many edits were performed that I could never list them all. I did my absolute best to try and fix everything, but alas, some were just not fixable...IMHO, the remaining errors don't really distract from the overall listening enjoyment.
