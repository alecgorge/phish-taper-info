Show Notes: 
- This long, fantastic version of Weekapaug included an On Broadway tease. At one point, the jam stopped completely before Trey counted everyone back in to finish the song.

Mastering Notes:
- This 2 Track master DAT was completely remixed. The DAT was a M/S with a stereo sub-carrier. This presented problems durring original playback, so it was decoded, and remixed back into a stereo representation. No major DSP processing was performed other than a slight ammount of BBE processing on the Mid and stereo sub-carrier channels durring the mixing stages.
- The beginning of Chalkdust has volume adjustments. There is also a short moment of static.
- 2 small drop outs were edited from Esther.
