Notes:
 In the Pharmers vol 6. this show is a one set show.  Although I got this
 from Greg Overall (THANK YOU) who make me a clone, and he got it from Kevin S.
 As you can see the first set is dead on with the Phamers, except my DAT had a Destiny on it.
 Since the my DAT has 2 sets on it, I believe this to be a 2 set show!
