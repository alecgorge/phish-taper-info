TAPER: John Redmond
SOURCE Nak 300s > D5 
patch source: Sony ECM-MS5s

AUD MCass (Maxell MX 100 min)> Sony TC-WE805S >
Art DI/O (48Khz, Input gain +10dB, No "Tube Warmth")>
Delta DIO 2496> WaveLab v4.0c> WAV (@24/48)> FLAC (archived) > Mastering > SHNv3

Mastering Notes:  the 24/48 FLACs were loaded into the Wavelab Audio Montage, and the NAK 300 source was lined up with the Sony ECM-MS5 source.  Patches from the Sony mic source occur in the following places: Approx. 55 seconds into Landlady there was a dropout (patched for 5 seconds).  After Funky Bitch there was a cut/dropout in the crowd noise (patched until first notes of Stash).  Following Lawn Boy there was a tapeflip and the Tweezer intro was cut (patched from first notes of Tweezer for about 9 seconds).  During Lizards, the Nak source was cut right after the "woah, woah" section, before the quiet building section (patched until the end of show).  I smoothed out level changes in Stash, Tube, and McGrupp > HYHU with vector based volume curves.

The following mastering processes were used: Waves REQ 2-band, rolloff at 42Hz, Blue Tubes FA770 compression, BBE Sonic Maximizer and the Waves L2.  The audio was downsampled to 44.1 with the 192KHz Stereo Resampler, and rendered to 16-bits with UVHR22 dithering.  The resulting .WAVs were tracked in CD-WAV and converted to SHNv3 (seektables appended).

Notes

The first Tweezer Reprise?

The taper ran two D5s from two different mic sources for this night and 9/21/90. The mics both nights were Nak 300s and Sony ECM-MS5s. For 9/20/90, the sources were not labeled on the tapes or tape cover as to which mics were used for each source.  Source information was determined by comparison with the 2 labelled sources for 9/21/90.

NO tracking/editing/alterations performed before archiving to 24-bit FLAC (except to trim silence from the ends).
