There was a strange white canvas ball hanging from the ceiling, 
on which various images were projected during the show. 
*With "Auld Lang Syne" tease(s). 
#During the song, fried eggs, udder balls, and olive loaves were 
projected on the canvas (in reference/relating to last night's narration). 
This was followed by the countdown and a balloon drop at midnight. 
The balloons broke both Page's and Mike's mics. 
^With a "Birdland" (Weather Report) tease. 
$Page sang this Frank Sinatra cover (first time played).
