I did the best I could with the names of the tracks
on disc one - since most of it is unreleased stuff - 
I guessed on a few - feel free to submit corrections
if you may know the correct song titles.
This is the most complete, and most HQ version of 
these sessions that I've yet heard, and felt they
deserved to be shared. Enjoy!
