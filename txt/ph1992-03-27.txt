April 15, 2008 fixes, by Jason Sobel
On the original seed, for some reason, the two channels were out of phase with each other.
To fix this, first I merged all the files into one long file.
Then I inverted the right channel in Samplitude SE v9.1.1, to be in phase relative to the left channel.
Then I split the tracks at the same points as the original seed, 
based on a .cue file I had created from the original split tracks.
When SHNtool re-split the tracks, it also took care of the several SBE's that were present on the original seed.
The resulting files were then compressed with FLAC v1.2.1, and re-tagged with metaflac v1.2.1
