this is definitely a sbd recording. i had to edit out tapeflips at around 47 minutes into each set, therefor proving to me it is a sbd. it was labeled to me as only 1 cass gen, and the only really irritating analog hiss is between songs, and when it is really quiet, other than that this recording sounds really sweet!
this is one of those classic great second sets where you can tell that the band could have cared less if there was an audience, they were just haveing a hell of a good time entertaining themselves. a must have in my opinion!!!

DISC 2 IS SET 2 IN IT'S ENTIRETY AND IS TRACKED FOR AN ****80 min CD****

enjoy!!!
