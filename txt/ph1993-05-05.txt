Show Notes: The jam after YEM featured The Aquarium Rescue Unit and the Dude of 
Life and was simply amazing. It also included a Who Knows tease. This show was 
full of anomalies, including variations on usually unchanged songs like My Friend 
and Cavern. A-Train was played for the first time since February 12, 1993 (58 shows). 
Trey dedicated Ya Mar to Sue on her birthday. Ya Mar subsequently included a Two 
Princes tease.
