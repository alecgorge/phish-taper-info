Mastering notes:
The source CD's were ripped with EAC. Weekapaug was missing from the masters used to make the CD's. I patched the Weekapaug using the Unknown source listed in the db.etree after fixing the pitch to match the source provided by KS. The Unknown source sounds like it is actually from this rig, just a few analog gens down the line.
