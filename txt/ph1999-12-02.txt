Show Notes: Farmhouse featured a slightly different arrangement, with an additional 
chorus at the end. Gin included ASZ teases before segueing into ASZ proper. YEM i
ncluded a silent jam. Little Drummer Boy emerged from the YEM vocal jam and ended 
with Fishman alone onstage.

Enjoy this awesome tour opener! Of note is the really interesting Gin. Please read the review of this show in "The Phish Companion."
