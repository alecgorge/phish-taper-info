~Mastering~
24/48 wav loaded into a montage for each set for reconstructing each set > each unprocessed 24/48 wav was then opened as a stereo wav to perform the following processes: BBE 1/4/0 > R-Bass @ 32Hz +5db > Waves C4 Multiband Compressor > Waves L1 for make-up gain > Waves X-Noise > 192kHz resampler to 44.1 > Waves L1+ for final gain adjustments and dithering to 16bit via Mode 1/Normal/Digital > FLAC 16bit
 
*NOTES*
This show speaks for itself. After having the FOB source for so long, I was suprised that this show surfaced as a SBD. Amazing jams all nite long. There is a cut near the end of Fluffhead that could not be fixed. There also appears to be a sopt of stretched tape durring Possum, but it is short lived. Whoever taped this off the DAT did it correctly by leaving some overlaps on the flips....this made it a snap to put back together seamlessly.
