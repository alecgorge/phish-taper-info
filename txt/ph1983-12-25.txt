Track 1 - Aud > Cass/? > CDR
          Fixes : CDR > EAC > Audacity > CDWAV > FLAC
          Fixes: Amplified, Removed Hiss, Added fade in and
          fade out, trimmed track marks. 
          
Notes: Due to the age of these, the rarity, and the uncertainty of the
       source info, this is likely the best copy of these 5 tracks that
       has circulated so far. I removed as much of the analog hiss that 
       I could, however it's far from completely gone. It's far superior
       to previous versions that have circulated.
