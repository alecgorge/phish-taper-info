From phish.net: 
Sbd/Aud mixes: The following shows were recorded to DAT from a separate recording board at the shows. They are some of the highest
quality Phish tapes in existence: 4/22/90, 10/30/90, 10/31/90, 11/2/90, 11/3/90, 11/4/90, 3/13/91, 3/15/91, 3/16/91, 3/17/91, 3/22/91,
3/23/91, 4/5/92. Except for the 4/5/92 tape, they have all been fairly widely circulated. They were done on a large recording console
(not EQ) and mixed completely separately from the board mix, rumoredly done in a truck outside the venue. The engineer used 2 audience
mics to mix in crowd/hall ambience (on most of them).
