Show Notes: Antelope included a Jibboo tease. The band skipped the second verse of Suzy. 

Great show, and a great sounding tape.  Thanks to Kevin and Matt
for the hookup!

There was a brief section of digi-noise in the Tweeprise... This was
on the master DAT.  I managed to patch the glitch (less than 1 sec.)
with a section from a MG210 > Aerco > SBM-1 source of this same show.
The patch was done because the Schoeps source sounds noticeably
better... or at least to my ears :)

Enjoy :)
