*Mastering Notes*
- Even though I was able to bring some of the bass back into the mix, if I were to have tried to raise it any more the mid registers would have gotten burried in the mud. 
- There is a pause after Runaway Jim. There was no silent part of the wave, it just appears as if the deck was paused and then restarted...I left this *as is*
- The start of Stash was missing from the tape flip...I crossfaded this as best I could...

NO tracking/editing/alterations performed before archiving to 24-bit FLAC
(except to trim silence from the ends).
