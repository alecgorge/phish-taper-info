**Mastering**
Set 1 and the end of set 2 were running slow/flat....since there was some overlap, bringing the material into tune with the rest of the show was easily done. The cuts were faded where necessary...The Fade out of the SBD/0 was matched exactly with the SBD/4, but then a cut happens shortly after...then the rest of the set finishes without incident. Sadly, the best part of Set 1 is missing...
