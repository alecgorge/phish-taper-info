Show/Set II story via Rob Livingston:

"Anyway, as we arrived for soundcheck, there were about 10 of us hanging out under overcast skies. 
Marley was running around and it was a great vibe. When the show started, 
it started raining lightly which became steadier throughout the set. 
Trey seemed to be playing the storm as the peaks occurred as the rain became sheets. 
The crowd grew throughout the set but to no larger than 50-60 people. 
Then came the thunder and a few shots of lightning. When it got to be its worst, 
Trey announced that due to the storm, they would be unable to finish the show." 

"While all were bummed (and most tripping), we understand and went back to our rooms to plan alternate activities. 
After about 30 minutes, word of mouth spread that they had agreed to play a second set in the Co-op lounge. 
All their equipment was packed away so they agree to use the gear of our campus cover band "Pi". 
When I arrived at the co-op there were about 10 of us and the set had just started. 
This was an extremely tight room (similar to the size of Nectar's upstairs). 
Probably another 30 people or so were able to cram in with the overflow listening outside. 
Pizza was ordered and a keg bought and brought in and the show continued to conclusion. It was amazing."
