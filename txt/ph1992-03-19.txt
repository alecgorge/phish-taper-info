-Notes
All the cuts//flips have been crossfaded...the only one that's real noticable is the one in Forbin. There are also some volume changes that were left as is.
^ has an amazing opening section...teases almost the entire 1st set...has 2 singals in the beginning...
+ slow version
% has some volume weirdness right at the start....
* these tracks have instances of tape weirdness....they are unfixable.
