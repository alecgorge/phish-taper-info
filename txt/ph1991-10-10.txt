Although they are master tapes, coming from an analog source there is still a small amount of hiss that can be heard.  I decided against editing out the hiss with Cool Edit, for I found that it digitally distorted the sound.  All in all, this show is phenominal...Trey's guitar is very prominent here...and that's a good thing.  ENJOY!!
