Notes
Things seem a little distorted/over-modulated in the bottom end, it's worst in the first few songs.  The second set sounds much nicer.

There is a level adjustment in Split Open & Melt which I covered with a volume curve.

A short crossfade covers a dropout in Fluffhead.

Terrapin is NOT dedicated to Cam Neely, but instead is dedicated to Marnie. Trey makes note that without Marnie "you wouldn't recieve the newsletter"... Marnie Davis worked for John Paluska until sometime in 91 or early 92.

NO tracking/editing/alterations performed before archiving to 24-bit FLAC
(except to trim silence from the ends).
