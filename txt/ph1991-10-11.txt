notes:
The original 48 kHz .wav files from the DAT transfer have been archived, and are available upon request.
These DATs were sent to me by Brett Stone, who received his DAT clones from Clay Ellwood.
Big thanks to Brett for sending me his DATs to transfer!

Disc 1 - [69:29]

Disc 2 - [18:24]
Set II (partial)
01 - [11:45] - David Bowie
02 - [06:39] - The Mango Song

show notes:
The start of "The Landlady" is cut.
A short tape flip cut at the very beginning of "The Lizards"
The end of "The Mango Song" is cut.

Obviously, the majority of set 2 is missing.  What we have here is 90 minutes of music.
It is clear that Bowie and Mango Song were included as filler, along with the complete first 
set, on a single 90 minute cassette.  Hopefully the missing portions of set 2 will surface. 
And hopefully it will sound this good when it does.  At the very least, it's a good thing 
we have the complete "David Bowie", because it's a great Bowie!
