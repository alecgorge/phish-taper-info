An excellent aud. recording of a show with members of the St. Louis Blues hockey team in attendance.  The mics used were volunteered at the last minute by someone.  Fierce believes they were AKG 1200's which were cardioid dynamics.  They don't seem to be around much now.

HUGE thanks to Fierce for taping & keeping the archives in good order so that these masters can be shared!
