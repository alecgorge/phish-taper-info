*The PA goes out in the middle of the song and then pops back on near the end. Phish plays the whole time. 

Show Notes: The P.A. went out during Rift, causing some giggles when Page sang 
"and silence contagious in moments like these." During Tweezer, Mike practiced part 
of what would become the Bass Jam on the following evening. Wilson included a 
Johnny B. Goode tease.

Disk2 is possible by taking out d2t9.  otherwise, 3 disks...

Notes:
-Resampled from 48k to 44.1K
-Slight fade of gain increase during the opening ~8 seconds of SOAM to make the level adjustments from the taper a bit more smooth.  This is the one reason to make me believe this is a tru FOB source... as well as during the Rift PA fault, the stage is quite clear
