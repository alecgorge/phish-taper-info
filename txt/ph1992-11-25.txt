Show Notes:
- Antelope has a Simpson signal.
- Shaft style jam in an otherwise very weird YEM.
- Trey stops Lizards before it starts becasue he can't remember the second verse, and to ask everyone about the Big Balls...and then they play it.
- Before Hood, Trey wishes everyone a "nice day tomorrow" (referring to the next day being Thanksgiving), and tells everyone to not feed any turkey to their dogs becasue it's bad for them.
- Sweet Adeline and Carolina performed without microphones.

Mastering Notes:
- Tape flips were patched with an unknown source, except the pause before the encore which was simply cross faded.
