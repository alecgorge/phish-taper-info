Pitch corrected, patched and retracked on 3/13/2005 by J. Treworgy (jamie@treworgy.com)

Set 2 (Source 2): Transferred from cassette and mastered by J. Treworgy on 5/6/2005

NOTES: This show has widely circulated as a "liberated bootleg" that sounds very good, 
but has many speed/pitch problems and cuts. I had a very nice cassette that generally 
sounds at as good as the bootleg, and is of known lineage. For Set I, the cassette had
a few analog-related problems so I decided to work with the bootleg as the primary source.
For Set II, the cassette had very different sonic characteristics. The bootleg for Set II 
has a lot of reverb added that is not found in my cassette, and basically the cassette just
sounded better. So I used it as the primary source for Set II and patched the tape flip 
using the bootleg.

Mastering notes

Set 1:

1) Pitch adjustments:
  -80 cents Buried Alive->Split
  -25 cents for Rift
  -80 cents for Fee
  -25 cents for Maze 
  -60 cents for Forbin-Antelope
2) Restored beginning of Fee  
3) Patched from last verse of Fee to beginning of Maze (cut on bootleg)
4) Patched Maze jam (edited on bootleg)
5) Patched Antelope ending (edited on bootleg)

Set 2:

1) Tape flip between Weekapaug and Horn patched from bootleg source. Pitch corrected patch source 
(bootleg) -20 cents to match cassette

Editing was done using Adobe Audition 1.5. All files converted to 32 bit before 
pitch correction. All digital processing done at highest quality settings. Transitions 
between sources, and between pitch-corrected segments, were crossfaded briefly.

No cassette noise reduction was attempted, nor do I think it's necessary, but I left a few seconds of 
pure tape hiss at the end of Set 2 in case someone wants to try it in the future.
