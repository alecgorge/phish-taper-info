Info From Kevin Shapiro: "11/3/90 and the other tapes of the era (10/30-11/4) 
were all done by Mike Grace through a separate 16 track mixer and ran direct to 2 
track DAT.  He basically used the same setup in Spring 1991 too."

Well, the other sources in circulation sound great, but if they can be even better,
why not? What you have here is the gold standard version of this show. This is a
100% digital transfer from a master DAT clone with no flaws and no cuts. While the
other sources in circulation are almost certainly based on this original source, 
they have unknown lineage and at least minor flaws. The most recent one is 
circulating as "unknown soundboard". More importantly, it's almost certain that 
this other source has gone through analog or other processing. 

The differences between this and the currently circulating source are as follows:

1. Source is of known lineage with no DAE. The technical quality is substantially
different. Peak levels are almost 100% higher than the other source, and use most
the full dynamic range. Since they are both obviously from the same original
recording I suspect that the other version was transferred from the master through
analog rather than digital, or some other processing got introduced along the way.
This source is a 100% unprocessed digital transfer from a master DAT clone.

2. Nothing has been cut between songs. The other version had been clipped for
space in Set I so it will fit on an 80 minute CD. This version will not fit on a
standard 80 minute CD, so you'll either need to overburn or use a longer CD. 
The pre-encore crowd chanting from the master DAT has also been included in Set II
and tracked separately so you can leave it off the CD if you want, though Set II
is still under 80 minutes.

3. There are no known flaws in this version. The other version has at least one 
digital flaw that I found, a split-second dropout in the beginning of Divided Sky.

4. This version is distributed as FLAC rather than SHN ;-) C'mon people isn't it
time to stop clinging to that ancient religion... FLAC compresses better, 
has integrated integrity checking so you don't need MD5 checksums, and you can
encode tag details into the files so you get CD-TEXT and all sorts of other
good stuff automatically. The FLACs in this distribution have been tagged. Long life 
FLAC! Death to SHN!
