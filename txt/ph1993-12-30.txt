Tech notes

I used EAC in secure mode to extract all tracks at 100%
no reported errors.  Cool Edit Pro 2.0 was used to align &
synch both of the sources.  This is a 50% SBD, 50% AUD mix.  
- Mixed by dan@am-dig.com
- Shn conversion done by dan@am-dig.com 9-JLY-2004 
- Artwork by dan@am-dig.com 300dpi - For best results
print at the highest resolution onto glossy photo paper.
Design for use with a clear slim double jewel case.

Notes

Both sources were recorded quite low.  I raised the levels
on the SBD 3db. I raised the levels on the AUD 4.5db.

Fade in/outs applied to the start and end of both discs. 

Missing 0:02.888 crowd on SBD source between Weekapaug Groove 
and Purple Rain (cassette flip).  AUD trimmed accordingly to 
match. This is smooth and most likely undetectable. 

Missing 02:27.000 crowd on SBD source between last song
and the encores.  AUD trimmed accordingly to match with 10 
second crossfade.  Smooth but ever so slightly detectable.

More Info On the SBD Source

Source: SBD > Panasonic 3700 (master DAT);
Master DAT played back on 3700 > Tascam pro analog deck 
(1st gen cass); Playback of 1st gen cass on Nak CR3A > 
Sony DTC700 @48kHz Master (from Sony DTC700) used in 
below transfer

Conversion: R500 > Canare Coax > Sek'd Prodif Plus > 
Soundforge 5.0  (fade in/out/edits/48>44.1 at highest 
setting[4of4] with anti-alias filter) > CD Wave > SHNv3 
via Monkey's/md5sum.exe (shn files have seek tables appended) 
**No DAE at all** 

Transfer was done twice, then inverted over itself to 
determine transfer errors. No errors were present or the 
errors that were present were inaudible and due to differing 
error correction on the DAT playbacks not transfer errors.

Detailed info: This was the seed for the phish.net tree in 
early 1994; see google files (txt) contained in this file 
set for more info. During this show there was occasional 
distortion in one of the drum channels--due to either a mic 
or mixer. This ispresent in all versions of the show, as it 
came through the PA. This same noise is also present in the 
8/20/93 Red Rocks SBD.

Minor Edits: Fades in/out beg/end of sets--5 sec in all 
cases All of the below was done at the 48k level, so there 
are edited and unedited 48k archive .shn's for archival:
First set cass flip: patched at the sample level as the 
music overlapped on the first gen cass and subsequently on 
the DAT--nothing missing at all!

Second set cass flip: cut out 45f and crossfade (duration 
of 2s26f) Break between set-2 & encore: cut several frames 
of silence and crossfade (duration of 4s45f) All crossfades 
were done at: source: -infdb to 0db and the destination: 
0db to -infdb. Edits took place after Paul and Silas, 
Weekapaug and Slave. 

Taper: Paul Languedoc
