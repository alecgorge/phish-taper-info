Show Notes: This show featured The Giant Country Horns. The horns guested on all 
songs except Oh Kee Pa, Hydrogen, Weekapaug, and Coil. Also, Mike's Song only included 
guest saxophone. Caravan included Manteca teases. Trey humorously botched the lyrics 
to Cavern, leading to some funny stage banter.
