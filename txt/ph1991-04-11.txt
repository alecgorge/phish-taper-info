*Multiple takes practicing "a dog" vocals. Several cuts. The last take is the most complete run through
HPB lists "Take The A Train" incorrectly instead of "Magilla".
There is a substantial cut in the middle of Possum, then again at the end (which was faded out).

**Mastering**
The show was running slow/flat. This was verified against my SBD Cass/3 of the same show. Using the cass/3 as a tuning guide, the show was brought into exact tune. The material was then passed through the Waves L3 to raise the gain to acceptable levels without introducing distortion.
