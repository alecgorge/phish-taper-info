notes:
The original DAT recording was made with pre-emphasis.
The Waves Q10 Paragraphic EQ v5.0 plug-in was used to de-emphasize the recording.
The original 48 kHz .wav files from the DAT transfer have been archived, and are available upon request.
Big thanks to Dave for letting me borrow the master DAT tape!

more notes:
Dave's source has been in circulation before this transfer.  This is a new transfer from Dave's master DATs.
I chose to re-transfer this show, because the previously circulating version did nothing about the pre-emphasis.
The Teac DA-P20 always applied pre-emphasis to the DATs (if you used the analog inputs).
As a result of the pre-emphasis, the circulated copy sounded a bit harsh, with the higher frequencies louder 
than they should have been (it's very noticeable on the cymbals).  This version has been de-emphasized, 
so it sounds more natural and is a better representation of how the show actually sounded.

In "You Enjoy Myself" at [22:52], there is a very small amount of digi-noise (at least, that's what it sounds like).
This noise also appeared on the previously circulating version, and is present on the master DAT.
It's very minor, but without another source to patch this small segment, I just left it the way it is.
It comes right at the very end of the vocal jam, and is hardly noticeable.
