notes: some cuts in the soundcheck.   The md5 for disc one is named without the D1. This is the first of a series of mostly uncirculated (as of 4/00) digital boards I will pump out in the near future. The track setup on this one places the soundcheck first, just my choice...rearrange if you want.    Please email me with any comments/concerns.  Thanks and enjoy the Batta Board!

Show Notes: My Friend included an Ob La Di, Ob La Da tease. BBJ featured 
Trey on drums and Fishman on vacuum. During BBFCFM, Trey forgot he was supposed 
to start part of the song, and there was quite a bit of silence on stage until 
he finally realized that the rest of the band was waiting for him. BBFCFM also 
included some humorous additional lyrics from Mike, who echoed a fan's cry that 
he could "smell [himself] running." YEM included teases of the closing jam to 
I Wish. Antelope included Random Note and Simpsons Signals.
