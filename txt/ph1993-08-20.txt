Show Notes: The band began the show with an appropriate opener, as the storm that had lingered in the 
Morrison sky cleared just before the show began. The Harpua story told the history of Red Rocks and 
the fate of a giant iguana, who was referred to throughout the show. Harpua also included a Rock and 
Roll Part Two tease. Ginseng was dedicated to Brad Sands and was preceded by a "Charge" tease from 
Page. Antelope included a Simpsons Signal and Gypsy Queen teases. Purple Rain featured Mimi Fishman 
joining Fish on vacuum. The Wedge was played for the first time since March 25, 1993 (62 shows).
