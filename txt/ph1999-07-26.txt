Show Notes: Disease was followed by a several-minute long, feedback-enhanced jam 
that also jammed the opening to Also Sprach before Mike redirected the band into 
SOAM. In fact, Fishman continued playing the Also Sprach drum beat underneath 
parts of SOAM. The second set ended with a speech from Trey that mentioned how 
happy the band was to be playing for their audience. Trey also spoke of the damage 
wrought at Woodstock 1999. He subsequently quoted Turning Japanese when mentioning 
the upcoming trip to Japan. Woodstock, which debuted at this show, was unfinished.
