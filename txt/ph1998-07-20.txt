Trey was chatty for the entire show. *With Crosseyed and Painless tease. **With
"Freebird" ending (instrumental, not a capella). ^Keyword was "skunk"; included a
Trey solo at the end. ^^Trey soloed 32nd notes for minutes on end. ^^^With glowsticks.
#First time played; original by Marvin Gaye; Fish swaying side to side and singing
karaoke-style from lyrics drawn on the back of a poster for the show; Trey on drums.
##Funked out, into a disco jam, into a delay loop jam (during which Trey had five or
more loops going at once), at the end of which they left the stage one by one (Trey, Fish,       Mike, then Page).
