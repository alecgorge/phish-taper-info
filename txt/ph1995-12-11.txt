Show Notes: Prince Caspian was preceded by Trey discussing how Portland was supposed 
to be Elvis' last show so this song was for his kid, the prince. The Dog Gone Dogs 
were part of Trey's announced "Dog Log" album and were preceded by Trey coaching the 
audience's reaction. Dog Gone Dog had not been played since August 2, 1993 (217 shows). 
Tube was played as a thank-you for helping out with the "album." Bowie included a 
long, spacy intro. Funky Bitch and WMGGW featured Warren Haynes on guitar.
