was fantastic and remains a fan favorite. 


Matrix Notes

Source 1 was decoded to wav using TLH. Both sources were aligned using Cakewalk Home Studio 2004.

Source 1 had better sounding bass than source 2. It also contained more recording from before/after the show and during the encore break. Source 2 had better highs and sounded more up close (possibly a FOB). 

I did not alter or EQ the sound of either recording. Both sources had qualities that complimented the other and when put together they make for a really nice listen. Source 1 had better stereo separation and Source 2 had less crowd noise.

I added fades to smooth out the listening experience at the beginning of both sets, the end of set 1 and after of the encore.
