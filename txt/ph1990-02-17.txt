*Editing Notes*
1) Tried to "adjust" the weirdness in the levels. Unfortunately, about the first 3 seconds of the song were unusable due to the levels and channel dropouts. I tried to smooth them out as best as possible...This does result in some hiss becomming very prevelant. 

2) Crossfaded the tape flip....you probably won't even notice it because I did it to the meter of the song.

3) Adjusted the levels to make them a little more even (sometimes this does result in some hiss, but hey it was worth it).
   
   3a) You won't hardly notice the tape flip that happens here.

4) Levels do rise here,and there is a short fade, but they were also raised in relation to all material in the mastering stage (not normalized).

5) The start of this song is completely "gone". the levels are so distorted that when brought into CD mastering levels, it is at levels that can damage speakers from the overload.....I just did a real fast fade to try and lessen the possiblity of damaging speakers from the level adjustment made at the board. The rest of the volume fluctuations are how they were....blame Paul ;-)

* the vocal jam is based upon the Led Zepplin song "The Ocean" from the album Houses of the Holy
