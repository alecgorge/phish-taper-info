* - preceeded by footage from the movie "Castaway" on the jumbotron screens on the scoreboard; with "Tom Hanks" (actually Page's brother Steve McConnell

** - "Seven Below" began approximately seven minutes before midnight; during the song a disco ball was lowered from within the scoreboard and it began snowing on stage; several dancers in white with blinking light "stick figure skeletons", dressed as snow creatures (with a vaguely "winter/forest kingdom" fantasy motif, including white costumes with fur and some horned helmets) came out and began circling the band on stage before moving off into the crowd - while in the crowd several grew into large snow angels by standing on covered ladders; midway during the song snow began falling on the fans on the floor from a pair of snowmaking rigs on the right and left sides of the scoreboard above the floor; shortly before midnight, the snow angels began shining small spotlights around the crowd, appearing similar to search lights

^ - at midnight, pyrotechnics spiraled around and behind the stage (some coming from the snowmaking rigs) and enormous white balloons with snow designs were dropped onto the floor

^^ - with "What's the Use" teases
