Show Notes: The ending of AC/DC Bag was unusual, as Trey repeated the closing guitar 
tweaks for quite awhile before breaking into the Tweezer riff. The key phrase in 
Makisupa was a play on the blues classic One Bourbon, One Scotch, One Beer. Cavern 
included Tweezer teases and a Moby Dick tease after Trey introduced Fishman under 
that name. Ha Ha Ha was played for the first time since September 9, 1999 (55 shows).
