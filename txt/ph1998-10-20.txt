Show Notes: This intimate show, performed in front of roughly 200 
fans and industry executives, was a taping for the PBS television 
show Sessions. Sleep and Driver were performed acoustic. Trey made 
jokes about the length of Guyute, remarking that the show could cut 
to four commercial breaks and the band would still be playing the 
same song. Taste was played after Trey took the crowd's requests 
for the final song. When the show was aired, only Birds, Ghost, 
and Taste were broadcast, with interviews interspersed between songs.
