Show Notes: The Contact opener started before the band took the stage, as they were 
driven to the front in golf carts. Some fans didn't even realize the show had started 
until well into Llama! This show was performed on a stage set up in the concession 
area of the amphitheater.

notes:
- d1t01 began with band members at the back of the crowd, rolling in on a golf cart
- all fades and crowd edit(before encore) were on the DATs
- master DATs are lost
- a Home Team recording
