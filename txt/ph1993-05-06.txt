**this is a beauty!**
notes: This is another in a series of mostly uncirculated (as of 5/00) digital boards I will pump out in the near future.   Sweet Adeline comes across as silence because it was not mic'ed, so I left it out. There is a 1/2 drop in the begining of Tela, and some sort of tiny skip shortly into Suzie.  Please email me with any comments/concerns.  
Thanks and enjoy!
