*NOTE*
The source info given to me was SBD. Granted, while this does sound like a SBD, I'd be willing to bet that this is an FM Simulcast. The source goes from mono > Stereo in the first set (you can clearly hear the difference at the start of It's Ice), and set 2 is mainly stereo. I think this was due to poor FM reception. There are errors/dropouts all over this source. Too many to note and/or edit. So what you hear is exactly as it was given to me. The longer dropouts were edited for continuity.
