An 11/23/85 Godard (side A) / Trey's 4 Track Project (side B) cassette tape used to circulate pretty well, the quality degrading with every analog generation.  I hope this is an upgrade of what you have heard and, if it is not, I apologize (and you can email me at cdirksen@earthlink.net to complain). I have not altered this recording with tools -- it is simply a reproduction via HHB onto disc of the cassette tape that I received in the 1990s.

I was generously given this music on a 90 min Maxell XL2S tape by a friend of Trey's.  He (among many others) had received the tape from Trey as a Christmas present a few days before Christmas in 1985.  

Mike has said that during this 11/23/85 show in the Godard cafeteria, he had a transcendent, peak musical experience. Listen to him carefully, ideally with no distractions.  I realize, though, that it is difficult to hear him on this recording. Also listen for "Norwegian Wood" and "The Other One" during the "Whipping Post Jam," which doesn't sound much like Whipping Post, but which presumably is a Jam that arose from Whipping Post's composed opening section (unfortunately, this intro section doesn't circulate).  But it is Trey who called this a "Whipping Post Jam" and so I'm reluctant to change the title to "Jam." I realize the recording quality is poor, but I swear to you -- IN THE NAME OF THE ALMIGHTY ICCULUS -- that this is low gen.  (Again, if it does not upgrade you, I apologize, but do me a favor and email me a .wav of the DEG to compare it with what I have.)

Show Notes for 11/23/85 from the current (8/20/09) version of The Phish Companion setlists file: This list for Set III is likely incomplete, as the only recording that circulates fades in and out at points. The “Whipping Post Jam” fades in after Mike’s Song on the recording that circulates. This “Jam” contained jams reminiscent of The Grateful Dead’s The Other One and Dark Star. It also featured Norwegian Wood teases from Mike, and a jam reminiscent of the early intro to Harry Hood. Antelope fades in after the “Whipping Post Jam” fades out. The complete lists for Sets I and II are not known, although Mike has referenced the first set Wild Thing in interviews and in The Phish Book.
