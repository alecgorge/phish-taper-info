Source notes:

At some point after the tour, I cloned the Master DAT recordings of the Concord, Shoreline and Sacramento Phish segments onto a single DAT. The only editing performed at that time was to trim the sets, beginning and ending each recording with a digital fade in/out (using functionality built into the cloning DAT deck, probably a Sony DTC-60ES DAT). Unfortunately, I made no notes about my location, so unless I can turn up a ticket stub (darn unlikely!), that info will remain lost. The first half of the set is missing because we got stuck in traffic on the way to the show. As is clearly audible, the levels are initially set too low, and are turned up between ~2:08 and again at ~2:55 or so, before being cut back at ~3:08. It's unlikely that I touched them again after that.
