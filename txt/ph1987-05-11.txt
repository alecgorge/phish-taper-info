Show Notes: This show included some funny stage banter, including Trey's announcement after TMWSIY: 
"That was called 'The Man Who Stepped Into Yesterday...and I'm going to get my head sharpened." 
A set break was announced after Ya Mar, so this is the complete first set. The list for the second set, 
though, is not known.
