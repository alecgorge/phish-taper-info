Show Notes: Faht was played for the first time since June 19, 1994 (99 shows).

Tech Notes: I applied fades at the end of each set...I did not apply fades at the beginning of the sets
due to the fact the music seemed to cut right in on my dat and I wanted to preserve as much of it as possible. 
That being said, I doubt very much is missing from either set, possibly only a couple seconds or even less.
