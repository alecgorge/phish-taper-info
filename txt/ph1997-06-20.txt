 Review of Prague 6/20/97 from phish.net / HPB 
-----------------------------------------------

1st Set: 

The Archa theater is located in the center of Prague.  It's a 
real theater usually not used for concerts.  The sound was 
excellent inside the venue and it had capacity for about 1000 
people. 

Taste: Nice way to open a show.  This was a 12 minutes Taste.
I was stunned by Page's solo. 

JAM: This was almost a House Jam.  It got everybody dancing in 
the venue... 

Cities: It jammed straight into Cities.  I'm glad they are 
covering it again. 

Horn: Trey played it just perfect.  No mistakes. 

Funny As It Seems: I remeber that this was a calm song but 
that's it. 

Limb by Limb: See Above. 

I Don't Care: I remember this song was really dark and heavy.  
Kind of a 70's song.  All I remember is that they jammed it for 
about 15 minutes. 

Run Like An Antelope: Not the best one I've heard but probably 
the wildest and the loudest I've heard. At the end of the song 
Trey changed the words: Instead of Marco Esquandolas he said 
"New Jersey Jack."  Then he said: "...to have any spike LADY..." 


2nd Set: 

David Bowie: 17 minutes Bowie.  Can you wish something more as 
an opener. 

Story of the Ghost: Very different as the one in Vienna. This one 
was longer (13 minutes) and had an amazing jam. 

Bye Bye Foot: New Fish tune. Very calm and slow. Very cute new 
song. 

Ginseng Sullivan: Let's dance... 

Cavern: Always fun. 

Twist Around:  New tune.  15 minutes long.  Amazing song.  This 
one is my favorite with Story of the Ghost. 

Bouncing Around The Room: Same as always.  I like to hear it. 

Julius: 10 minutes Julius.  This is the best version I ever heard 
and probably the highlight of the show.  Trey couldn't be stopped 
on this one. 

Encore: 

When the Circus Comes to Town: Nice cover. 

Rocky Top: I hoped they wouldn't finish on a calm song.  Rocky Top 
was the best way to end the show.
