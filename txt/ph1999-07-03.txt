Show Notes: Mist debuted at this show, though it was played on Trey's tour. The Little 
Drummer Boy encore was performed by Fishman, solo on the snare drum, with alternate 
lyrics. Bill Bailey featured Page's father, Dr. Jack McConnell, on vocals and kazoo. 
Meatstick was played for the first time since June 25, 1997 (123 shows).

Additional notes about this source:
257ms dropout in the final seconds of Antelope removed (audible but not painfully)

Mark Nutter kindly allowed Scott to run this rig throughout the Summer tour. 
A 15ft digital line from Scott's PDR1000 was connected to a digital patchbay 
from which a great many tapes were recorded, including some of the previously 
circulating sources. After the tour, all of the master DATs were cloned for 
Mark Nutter. Subsequent clones from Mark Nutter's copies have also been seeded 
over the years. This series is the first transfer of the master dats at the head 
of this chain.

Thanks to Mark for the gear. Thanks to Scott for running it and 
thanks again to Scott for lending me the masters to transfer.

Enjoy
