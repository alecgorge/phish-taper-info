Good Times Bad Times	(04:52)*the original .shns (source was listed as "DSBD --> Dat (that'sall I know) Sound great!!!") were not split on sector boundaries(only disc 1). I took the original .shns, decompressed them, putthe .wavs back together in CoolEdit, and then cut them upcorrectly in CDWAV. Disc 2 was redone as well, just for the sakeof splitting up a couple of tracks that weren't split on theoriginal .shns.Questions or comments to chad.plemons@mindspring.com-Chad
