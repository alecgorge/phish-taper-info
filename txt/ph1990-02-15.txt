*Notes*
This seems to be a monitor patch. There's barely any Trey or Vocals in the mix and there are volume adjustments are all over the place. I decided to just leave it be, just as raw as it was laid down on the tape. *I patched a few drop outs by applying the opposite channel over them when available. All tape flips were crossfaded as smoothly as possible.

NO tracking/editing/alterations performed before archiving to 24-bit FLAC
