This is one of my _all time_ favorite Phish shows.  I got this directly off 
the master cassette, so this is the best possible source.  There was a third 
set to this show, but the taper's ride needed to leave after the second set, 
so unfortunately this is all we have, and the rest is history.

PS - Dolby tip.  As this was encoded with Dolby C when it mastered onto cassette, 
that means you ideally play it back (decode) with Dolby C.  Pass this on to any 
analog folks this show goes to, please:  Never use Dolby to record, only to play back.
