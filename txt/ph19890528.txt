This is an upgrade of the version currently on "The Spreadsheet" for several reasons, even though that version's source purports to be a cass0 (it doesn't sound like one!). First, the band members kinda sound like their balls are being pinched together on that version. (Compare, e.g., whenever Trey sings in the high part of his range, like in a goofy way during Contact.) If anything, the source tapes of this version are a hair slow. In any event, the pitch of this copy sounds far closer to reality as I hear it than the current Spreadsheet version (hopefully Kevin Hoy, Master of the Spreadsheet, will replace that version with this one).  

Second, the Spreadsheet version of the Slave has at least another ten seconds missing than this version.  Also, this version, unlike the current Spreadsheet version, has the post-YEM, hysterical banter concerning the effort to find a sober driver for a keg run. 

FLAWS: Cut in the first 45 seconds of Slave (tape flip); banter was cut out (not by me) after Ride Captain Ride and before Peaches, Mango and JJLC; cuts at the beginning of SOAM, the Jam that starts set 3, and Sloth; significant wow and flutter, as well as a bit of tape warbling at one point, during the (fast) Sanity; and Funky Bitch has a very nasty and abrupt cut. 

I hope this is an upgrade for you. If it isn't, I hope you transfer it and put it on etree and please let me know (charlie at phish.net). If you haven't heard this early show, it's one of a handful of must-hear 1980s shows in my opinion -- not only for the banter between songs, almost all of which is entertaining, but also for the playing. (e.g., Trey gets paid by the note in YEM in particular, and its vocal jam is ridiculous.) You can hear every band member contribute to the banter between songs here and there, too. The current Phish.net setlist and shownotes read as follows:

Notes: Trey dedicated the Divided Sky opener to “the spirit of the pig.” Trey briefly teased "TMWSIY" before Antelope, which included the word “spliff” instead of “spike” in the lyrics. This YEM featured the infamous “Poop Vocal Jam,” followed by a set-stopping keg run. Mike’s Song included a tease of the HBO theme song. Sanity was the fast version.  'A' Train featured "Paul," an unknown audience member, on saxophone. During Contact, Trey wished the crowd "Merry Christmas" several times and teased Auld Lang Syne at the end of the song. The first known Phish performance of Funky (Breakdown) as well as Price of Love featured guest appearances by Ninja Mike (vocals) and Magoo (guitar). Fishman intermittently played trombone and vacuum during the latter. The vocal jam at the end of Sneakin' Sally included Changes (David Bowie) and My Sharona (The Knack) quotes. Ya Mar's lyrics included references to wild pigs and Paul.
