Known flaws:

Source has a few issues but is otherwise good for the only source available.
Level issues early on Golgi
I removed a dropout during the crowd noise after Suzy.
Dave's Energy Guide jamming during Tweezer
Some sort of tape flip cuts out the end of BBFCFM

Show Notes:

YEM has a 'Stop it!' theme.
Fishman yells 'What a bitch!' during Suzy.
Auld Lang Syne jam in Suzy
MacArthur Park lyrics by Trey during Tweezer
