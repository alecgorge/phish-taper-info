Mastering Notes:
This a near flawless AUD, great sound, great performance.  The tapeflips were smoothed with crossfades (try and find the one in the YEM vocal jam!), there was also a small drop out fixed during the YEM vocal jam.  There was a level change in Highway to Hell which I fixed with vector-based volume control.  Tape was stopped between the last tune and encore, I smoothed this out with a long crossfade.  

The 24/48 FLACs were converted to .WAV and opened in the Wavelab Audio Montage, all edits were performed at the 24/48 stage.

The following mastering processes were used: Waves REQ 2-band, rolloff at 42Hz, Blue Tubes FA770 compression, BBE Sonic Maximizer and the Waves L2.  The audio was downsampled to 44.1 with the 192KHz Stereo Resampler, and rendered to 16-bits with UVHR22 dithering.  The resulting .WAVs were tracked in CD-WAV and converted to SHNv3 (seektables appended).

Notes

// indicates cassette flips

The taper ran two D5s from two different mic sources for this night and 9/20/90. The mics both nights were Nak 300s and Sony ECM-MS5s. For 9/21/90, the sources were labeled on the tapes and tape cover as to which mics were used.

WOW!  This is my favorite tape from the Oldschool batch so far - the second set is epic.

NO tracking/editing/alterations performed before archiving to 24-bit FLAC (except to trim silence from the ends).
