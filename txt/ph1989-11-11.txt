03. Bathtub Gin
04. AC/DC Bag
05. My Sweet One
06. You Enjoy Myself
07. If I Only Had A Brain
08. Frankenstein ^


^ earlist known version, possibly a debut. With horns.

Notes: The horns on Frankenstein are likely Dave Grippo and Russ
Remmington, who had jammed with Phish recently, on 10/20/89 at
The Front, however the horn players are not announced, and this is a
best guess.
I did a mail trade for this a long time ago. The only problems with
the original CDR is that it was tracked wrong.
I used CDWAV to retrack it, and Audacity 1.2.0 to add fades to the start 
and end of the set.
Since this does not circulate in a lossless format at all, I figured I'd
get it out there.
Enjoy!
