Show Notes:
- All Things Reconsidered tease at the start of Foam. 
- The second set was preceded by birthday wishes for a fan named Amy and a remark that Buried Alive was inspired by Jimmy Herring. 
- Bowie included Simpsons and Oom Pa Pa Signals.
- Possum included a Random Note and two Fingerscrape Signals (including one from Mike!).
- Marley made a special guest appearance as "the evil, evil dog Harpua." This version, set in the "teeming Brazilian rain forest," is a must-hear. There was a brief full-band Fire tease, high-pitched "Brazil" squawks from Fishman, and a preview of the Clifford Ball motto (four years early) as Trey introduced Page as "a beacon of light in the world of flight."

Mastering Notes:
- The middle of Fluffhead contained a tape flip. This was crossfaded as best as possible.
- There is a tape flip after Lizards. The flip cuts into Cavern by about 1-2 seconds. This was crossfaded as best as possible.
- The Harpua is from a different source and was faded in. No music is missing.
