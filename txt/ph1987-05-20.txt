Show Notes: 
- This setlist may be incomplete. It was taken from a video that circulates. 
- Alumni featured guests on rhythm guitar and saxophone. These guests were members of local bands The Joneses and Mental Floss. 
- The show was a co-bill with The Joneses and was played for forty or fifty people in front of a big red barn-like house, with the band playing on an actual stage.

Mastering Notes:
- This transfer was from an unknown VHS....it does exhibit signs of its age. There are moments of tape static which could not be repaired. This source does, however, sound significantly better than what had been circulating....flaws and all.
