I don't recall whether I used external mics or the built-in mics on the
TCS-430.  Considering the deck, it probably doesn't matter that much.
Audacity was used to normalize, split tracks, resample to 44.1KHz and
save resultant files as 16-bit .wav files.  The .wav files were then
converted to flac.

Setlist:

1. Chalkdust Torture
2. The Landlady
3. Runaway Jim
4. Guelah Papyrus
5. You Enjoy Myself
6. Uncle Pen
7. Llama

There was a tape flip between Uncle Pen and Llama and I apparently missed the
first few seconds of Llama.

Recorded on a Sony TCS-430 with some unknown (pretty cheap) mics onto a
Maxell XLS-II.

Played back on a Nakamichi CR-1 and recorded onto an Alesis ML-9600 at
24-bit, 96KHz.

The resulting .wav file was normalized, tracked, resampled to 44.1KHz and
saved as RBCD-compliant .wav files using Audacity version 1.3.11 beta.

There is some wind noise.  Sometimes the crowd noise is a bit annoying, but
then again, it always is.  Overall, not a bad recording considering the $99
tape deck.
