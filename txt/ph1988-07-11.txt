key: * =  the tape that I traded was a Maxell Metal 110 mins. but was cut like a 90 min. tape.

** =  I did some editing work to smooth out things pretty much as best I could using fade ins, & outs, 1 cross fade, & 2 very small high cuts that after listening to them sounded better to my ears than the originals. hopefully you wont even notice. other than that there were a few various defects on the tape that I fixed up as best I could.the worst of the cuts are in "The Curtain"(@ 19:02)that I fixed. the next one was a defect in "Fire"(@38:13)that I fixed. Alumni & Col. Forbins have small defects that I left alone.

 azimuth adjusted for your listening pleasure.  Still the couple of gens that are on the tape come through with some noticeable hiss. Which really only makes it hard to listen to, with headphones on.

***I was going to include the story about that day & night but we'll leave that for another time.
