-Show Notes- 
- This show contained the first known Poor Heart.
- Tweezer contained fairly extensive Heartbreaker teasing by both Trey and Mike. 
- After Tweezer, the band introduced and thanked the tour crew, presenting them with a cake and customized bowling balls.

-Mastering Note-
These tapes appear to be from a Mid-Side setup. The channels were both mono, with the right channel being exactly 90 degrees out of phase. The bass was also very distorted. Upon mastering, once I had set up my mixer for mid-side decoding, the source sounded just like it should. There is still some distortion present from the low end after decoding, but it is very tolerable. -Marmar
