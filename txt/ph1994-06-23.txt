 This is a great show, but this recording has some problems.  There was a pretty bad storm that night, and the wind and rain show up on the tape at times.  Otherwise, it sounds pretty darn good.  Unfortunately I do not remember which capsules were on the mics that night and I didn't write it down - sounds like the hypers to me.
