notes by John Beatty (johnbeatty@mail.com):

Flaws:
- The first few minutes of Mike's is at the end of d1t13 (Llama) and
then
   repeated in full on d2t1.  (You may wish to fix this before burning).
- Carolina cuts in at beginning (probably on source - my old cassette
is missing
   it entirely
- Dropout/missing samples in AC/DC Bag at 4:19
- Dropout/missing samples in Runaway Jim at 1:12
- Dropouts/missing samples in YEM at 4:44, 14:34:46 and 14:34:68

Dropouts are all around one second (too long to just delete - I suggest
a reseed if one can be found).
