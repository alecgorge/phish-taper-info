Notes: Interesting early soundboard. AC/DC cuts in and sounds muddy at first, then the
sound clears up. Minimal hiss. Whoever is doing sound (Paul?) is "soloing" as he mixes and
this is picked up in spots on the recording. (for example he solos Page, and all you can hear is
piano, or he'll solo Mike, and all you can hear is bass.) This goes on throughout the entire recording.
It was likely caused by the feed from the soundboard, and there was no way to correct it.
Bowie is listed on setlists, but is missing from this recording, and YEM gets cut about 5 minutes in and the
rest is missing to history.
More of a gap filler than anything,  rare and kind of obscure.
Enjoy!
