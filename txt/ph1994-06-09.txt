Source Notes: I'm not 100% sure on the source of these discs but this is what 
the person I got them from thought they were, although they weren't positive.  
This is the only source I've seen circulating so it is probably true. Some have 
a Lunatec V2 listed as a preamp but I didn't include that in the lineage because 
I don't have any real evidence to support this. In any case, the show sounds pretty 
good and seems to be problem free so I hope we can look past the uncertain source info.

Tech Notes: I extracted the cds as a range and resplit the tracks using CDWAV. The EAC 
logs for each disc are included. There was one fade between discs that I removed. There 
was enough overlapping music allowing me to join the 2 tracks together and resplit them 
without any fade. There was also a fade that eliminated some crowd noise between the 
second set and encore that I left in. I also added fades at the beginning and end of 
each set in soundforge. No other processing was done on my part except for running the 
fileset through shntool in order to remove SBE's that existed due to t
