Show Notes: The vocal jam out of YEM included Shaggy Dog quotes. 

Notes:
Mike's bass solo in YEM starts with P-Funk riff, proceeds into very abstract
interaction with Fishman.  At one point during the vocal jam,
Trey sings, "Ay ay ay ay, I'm a frito bandito," indicating his
state of mind.  The Shaggy Dog out of YEM was performed a capella.
Page teases Cold As Ice immediately before Chalk Dust.
Carolina was performed a capella with no mics.
