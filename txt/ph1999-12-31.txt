Show Notes: After Midnight debuted at this show. During the Jim opener, fans participated in 
marshmallow and tortilla wars while also releasing many balloons. I Didn't Know featured Fishman 
(introduced as 'Soda Jerk') on vacuum. SOAM was unfinished. After the ensuing Catapult, Trey remarked 
that they could only get away with playing a song like that at the largest concert in the world. The 
late set, also known as "The Show," began at around 11:35. Father Time was on stage, pedaling on an 
exercise bike that powered a large clock. The sounds of the clock's gears could be heard through the 
sound system. About ten minutes before midnight, Father Time collapsed from exhaustion and the clock 
stopped. Then, a large fan boat entered the concert field and approached the stage. Early in its 
journey, the fan boat exploded away and revealed the hot dog used in the 1994 New Year's stunt. While 
the band rode the hot dog to the stage, an instrumental version of Meatstick began to play over the PA. 
The band reached the stage and fed several meatsticks to Father Time, reviving him so that the clock could 
continue moving toward midnight. The band then took the stage and played Meatstick to begin The Show. 
Heavy Things was recorded live and rebroadcast as part of ABC television's New Year's Eve coverage. 
In a humorous effort to confuse the home audience, Trey instructed the crowd to chant the word 
"cheesecake" in lieu of cheering at the end of the song. Trey then introduced the band for the 
rebroadcast and offered a message of peace and harmony for the world where he reminded people to 
drive in the right lane unless passing another vehicle. Meatstick was subsequently teased as the New 
Year approached in the central time zone. Sand included a My Soul tease from Mike and Crosseyed 
included a DEG tease. YEM included a vocal jam based around the word "cheesecake" and Trey altered the 
lyrics to Axilla and Albuquerque to reference the word. Quadrophonic Toppling debuted, albeit with 
different music than on The Siket Disc. Rock and Roll included an After Midnight tease. Love You 
included band introductions; Fishman introduced Page before the song and Mike and Trey afterwards, and 
the band as Phish 2000 (see November 2, 1990). ASZ began with the signature Hood drum roll. After the 
show closed with yet another version of Meatstick, the Beatles song Here Comes the Sun was piped 
through the crowd at sunrise. Several breakouts were played: Albuquerque (first since December 28, 1998,
 or 67 shows), Crosseyed and Painless (first since August 13, 1997, or 158 shows), and Love You (first 
since July 5, 1997, or 178 shows).
