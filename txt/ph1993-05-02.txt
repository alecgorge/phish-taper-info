Show Notes: 
- YEM included Speed Racer and Oye Como Va teases. 
- Antelope included Simpsons and All Fall Down Signals. 
- After Antelope, Fishman listened to the crowd's requests, including Trey's request of Undun, before settling on Rosie.
- Sleeping Monkey was delayed while Trey scrambled to remember the lyrics. He remarked that it was particularly embarrassing since Tom Marshall was in the audience. 

Tech Notes:
-All indicated cuts were crossfaded. 
-Most of the BBJ is missing. 
-Amazing Grace was not on SBD tapes.
-What was on the tape is on here, no fancy edits or patchwork. There are flaws, but nothing too distracting.
