Show Notes: This show, which featured The Giant Country Horns for most of the second 
and third sets, began with a humorous announcement from Trey that he felt "overdressed" 
during National Nudist Week. My Sweet One included a tease of the "Bonanza" 
theme and Magilla included a "Flintstones" tease. Possum included an Oom Pa Pa Signal 
and a Dave's Energy Guide tease, while Weekapaug included Tweezer teases from Trey. There 
was a long wait during HYHU for Fishman, who was apparently in the bathroom. Hood included 
full-band "Jeopardy" theme teases. This show ran much longer than scheduled (at one point, 
when Trey noted that they should wind up the show, a fan urged the band to "fuck the clock"), 
prompting Trey to beg the crowd to leave in a timely and orderly fashion after the encore.

NOTES

flaws in original (SBD) noted in info file:
d1t05 there´s a dropout in the SBD tape before Golgi and the beginning
      of Golgi is cut. starts at "with a ticket stub..."
d1t11 like Golgi, there´s a dropout in the SBD tape before Possum
      (very last second of I Didn´t Know also missing) and the beginning
      of Possum is cut. starts during instrumental intro section
d2t02 diginoise in the vocal during Suzy Greenberg
d2t10 and again a drop in the SBD tape before Antelope (very end of
      Cavern cuts) and the first few notes of Antelope are missing
d3t01 closed gap @ 0:05, probably a few seconds missing

additional flaws in original:
d1t01-d1t04 left/right channels unbalanced until 2:39 in Golgi
d1t01 Reba louder than rest of the tracks in the first set
d1t01 Clicks in Reba at 5:10 & 7:02
d1t01 fuzz in Reba at 13:08
d1t03 dropout in Squirming Coil at 2:50
d1t07 same noise as Suzy in the vocal on Forbin
d2t01 cut at the very beginning of Suzy
d2t03 fuzz in Divided Sky at :27 
d2t05 buzz in Dinner & a Movie at :35 
d2t06 dropout in ambience/crowd at the end of SOAM 
d2t09 click in "give the director" 
d2t10 clicks in Antelope intro at 1:38
d2t10 buzzes in speech at end of Antelope 
d3t05-6 beginning of Mike's missing 
d3t08 buzz in Weekapaug vocal at 6:06
d3t09 cut at beginning of Touch Me (2:30) 

The FOB source didn't have cuts in any of the same places as the SBD, 
so I was able to pretty easily patch over the dropouts listed above.  
The FOB source has some serious phase issues, but the patches are all 
short enough that it isn't too noticeable.  It's a shame, because 
otherwise the FOB has good sound.  The patches are easily detectable 
as the sound is a bit different between the two, but overall they're 
pretty smooth.  Or as smooth as possible in one or two cases.  I had 
to use really quick fades because of the phase problems, so "Touch
Me" is a little uglier than I'd like.

The "diginoise" in Suzy and Forbin is actually some kind of distortion 
in the vocal and is also present on the FOB.  The buzzing sound is a 
collection of closely spaced clicks that I was able to clean up.  There 
is still some distortion present in spots, but it's a lot less obvious 
and annoying. 

I balanced out the levels by increasing the left channel by 5dB from 
the end of Reba to 2:39 in Golgi, then lowering the left channel by 2dB 
and the right by 5dB in the first 2/3 of Reba. 

Since it's a rather thin sounding board, I ran it through a multiband 
compressor to beef up the low end and tighten up the high end.  This 
also made it easier to match the levels for the patches.

Compressor settings:
0-120Hz: 4:1 Th:-12 +8dB At:5ms Rel:50ms
120-800Hz: 1.2:1 Th:-12 At:1 Rel:50
800Hz-4kHz: 1.4:1 Th:-35 +1dB At:1 Rel:25
4-24kHz: 1.4:1 Th:-30 +2dB At:2 Rel:20

I have also put together another version without the compression 
(referred to as the "patched" version) for those out there who are into 
the less is more processing philosophy.  Enjoy.


Cheers!
John
