RME Fireface 800 audio interface @ 24-bit 96kHz

Processing in Sound Forge 10.0:
24-bit 96kHz version:
     Waves L1+ Ultramaximizer (limiting, dither, noise shaping)
16-bit 44.1kHz version for CD:
     iZotope 64-bit Sample Rate Converter (resample to 44.1kHz)
     Waves L1+ Ultramaximizer (limiting, dither, noise shaping, 
     conversion to 16-bit)


Notes:

- The end of "It's Ice" and the beginning of "I Didn't Know" are chopped due to 
running out of tape.

- There is also a quick tape flip just before "NICU" but I don't think the song 
is cut.

- If you prefer to save a disc, the encore would fit on the end of the first disc.

- Thanks to David N. for the loan of the master and to Edmund for figuring out 
that this tape needed to get into circulation.
