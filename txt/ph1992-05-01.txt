Announcements

(*)  with "sans bag" bagpipe solo, from "The Piper" (Fishman)
(**) with extensive "secret language" in the intro


Show Notes: I Didn't Know featured Fishman on the Bag-Vac in what was the 
instrument's last known appearance. 

Set I:

This is the Italian-import bootleg CD titled simply "SLOTH."  My girlfriend-at-the-time gave
this to me as a gift, around five years ago.

It should be noted that I would personally NEVER buy a bootleg CD (you shouldn't, either)--
nor would I support bootlegging (i.e., profiting off the music) in any way.  Bootleggers
disgust me.  Therefore, I am making these tunes available (free-of-charge, of course!) on
ETree.  Long live ETree!

EAC log is included in separate text file EAC-log-ph1992-05-01.I.TXT.  Track 5 had three (3)
suspicious positions (3:33, 3:39, and 3:44) but ended up sounding fine anyway.  Even after
thoroughly cleaning the CD, I couldn't do better, sorry.  (The CD has been abused in the
past.)

Track 8 (Guelah Papyrus) is only 1:21.  This is the way it appeared on the disc.  It might
be more appropriately titled "Guelah Papyrus Reprise" as they only play a small portion
of the song!  You be the judge.

Any comments or questions, e-mail me (address is above).  Thanks.
