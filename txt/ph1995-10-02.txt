***Note*** There are level adjustments in Acoustic Army and Hello My Baby. Also, there is a tiny ¼-second dropout in bowie (it happens during one of the pauses between trills in the ending section). Also, there are a couple of minor clap noises in poor heart around 0:37; this was checked on the DAT to make sure it wasn't a transfer error. The noise is indeed on the DAT. Also, much of the post set 2/pre-encore noise was not on the DAT (I did not remove this).

This passed shntool len (there are no SBEs)

Thanks to Brandon Johnston for the DATs.
