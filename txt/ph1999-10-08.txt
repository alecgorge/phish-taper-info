Show Notes: Sofi Dillof joined the band for the Meatstick Dance. We're Not Gonna 
Take It (from The Who's Tommy; not the Twisted Sister song) debuted with Tom Marshall 
singing and performing various stage antics. Tweezer included a brief Sand tease and 
a jam somewhat akin to My Left Toe. The Coil outro included a Bug tease from Mike. 

NOTE:
Unfortunately, the FOB tapers were shut down during Harry Hood.
I have spliced in the following source to complete the show:
DPA 4011's > V2 > Apogee AD500 > DA-P1 (recorded by Ron Dalton)
Starting at 11:58 in Harry Hood, and the rest of the show after that, is from the DPA 4011 source.

Also, in Piper, there was one point where the levels probably got bumped up mistakenly,
and the right channel was heavily clipped.  I used the DPA 4011 source to replace this short segment,
for a length of approximately 20 seconds starting at 04:18.

One other thing to note about the DPA 4011 source is that the overall recording level is louder.
For the patch in Piper, I adjusted the levels on the DPA source to match the Schoeps, so the patch would be smoother.
For the splice in Harry Hood, and everything after the splice, I left the DPA source levels as orginally recorded.
