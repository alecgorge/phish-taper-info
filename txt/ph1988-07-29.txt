**Mastering**
The show is plagued by distortion. Levels were left untouched from the original. The show was running slow/flat. This was corrected by time stretching the material to 97.003% its original size. The cut on Whipping Post misses much of the jam...this was crossfaded to the next track. Resampled and dithered, then tracked.

While not a great recording by any means...it's a moment of Phishtory that was captured...enjoy it as such =)

NO tracking/editing/alterations performed before archiving to 24-bit FLAC
(except to trim silence from the ends).
