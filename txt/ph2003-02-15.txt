Notes: 
* - 	with "Stash" tease; 
** - 	Towards the end of the song, 
	the band stopped playing and Trey started to do a little jig - 
	after a few moments, Fishman began mocking him by doing something similar 
	and as a result for about a minute the band was just dancing instead of playing
