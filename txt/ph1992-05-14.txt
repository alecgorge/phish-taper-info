Mastering Notes:

SET I

1) Crossfaded 0.5s at end of Reba into beginning of Poor Heart, probably at cassette flip
2) 1.3s dropout at beginning of Bouncing corrected by duplicating the next bar and mixing in some audience noise.

SET II

1) Lowered pitch by 25 cents
2) Corrected dropout (no missing data - must be DAT->Cass cassette flip) around 46:00(weekapaug)
3) Patched 9 second dropout at 51:36 (Weekapaug), probably at cassette flip
4) Patched 1 second dropout at 00:07 in HYHU
5) Patched 2 second dropout at 8:53 in Possum
