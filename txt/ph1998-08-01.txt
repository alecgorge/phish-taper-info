Notes: Fade In/Out done in Soundforge.  I also added a bit of leader
from another source to piper(the start of set 2) because a couple notes 
of piper were missed on the master.  So @ 52 seconds into piper you hear 
the splice.  The notes are correct but you hear the difference from being 
way back in the tapers section to fob.  So the spliced source for the first 52 
seconds of crowd noise before piper is Schoeps MK41/CMC6>SX-M2>DAP1 
(in tapers section).  Thanks to mikey for the smokin tapes.
enjoy~

=========================================================

NOTE: I received these .shns from the person who converted them originally (edlhubermj18@mail.uww.edu), and found, using shntool, that 3 tracks were not cut on sector boundaries. They were:
d1t09
d2t01
d3t04

d2t01 definitely had to be fixed, as it caused a nasty click during the transition from d2t01 to d2t02 when listening to the audio on a CDR burned in DAO mode. d1t09 and d3t04 were fixed for good measure as well; whenever shows start to be put on new media (DVD-R?) and are subject to new tracking, this show can be sequenced in any way desired without any problems.

Original sector boundary errors found using:
SHNTOOL version 1.01
Copyright 2001 Jason Jordan (shnutils@freeshell.org)
.shn utilities page:  http://shnutils.freeshell.org/

After sector boundaries were fixed, I converted back to SHNv3 from .wav using MKWact, and renamed all files back to their original filenames, removing the '-fixed' appended to each file by shntool, and redid the .md5s to match the new files (this is the only set of .shns from this show *from this new DAT source* that is available, so having the '-fixed' indicator wasn't necessary; the .shns with errors were never circulated before being fixed).

Log info from shntool output is provided in the file ph98-08-01fob_sector_issues.txt.

RECORDING COMMENTS: Aside from what is written above about the lead-in source spliced  for Piper (d2t01; a very minor portion was missing from this FOB source), there is only one questionable noise I can hear on this show after about 4 listens. At 1:39 of d2t08 (Brian and Robert), there is a pop in the left channel. I am 99.9% sure it is a balloon pop, and not a digital error.
What does that mean? This show is clean! Please circulate if you enjoy this new FOB source of this great show over any others already out there!
