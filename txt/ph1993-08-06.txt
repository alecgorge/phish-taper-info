Show Notes: Listen for repeated Tequila teases in Suzy Greenberg, Tweezer, Guelah 
Papyrus, and YEM, as well as a Simpsons Signal in Guelah Papyrus. The YEM vocal jam 
was to the tune of Cocaine and included some Tweezer lyrics. Slave was played for 
the first time since October 24, 1991 (237 shows).

Notes:
The 2nd set of this show is all that circulates in SBD form. 
The right channel was boosted 3.5dB to match the left channel which was recorded slightly higher, 
editing was done in Sound Studio. 
There was a cassette flip just before YEM, dead space removed.
