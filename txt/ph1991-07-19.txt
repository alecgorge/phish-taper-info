Show Notes: This entire show featured the Giant Country Horns. I Didn't Know featured 
Mimi Fishman on vacuum. The hi-hat segment of Bowie included Bouncing teases and YEM 
included Frankenstein teases. This long, strong Tweezer featured a Divided Sky tease 
from Trey, as well as lots of impromptu rapping. The band introduced the horns during 
BBFCFM, which also included a quick tease of the "I Love Lucy" theme. Runaway Jim was 
sung as "Runaway Yim" and Lawn Boy featured a trumpet solo.
