Show Notes: This show was webcast live by the House of Blues and featured a blistering 
YEM in the first set. During I Didn't Know, Trey noted that Michael "Soft G" Jordan 
would be turning the mic over to "Flagina" Fishman, who then took a vacuum solo. During 
Meatstick, Trey added to the summer hoopla surrounding the Meatstick Dance. He noted 
that the band was going to try to get into the Guinness Book of World Records by having 
the most people doing a single dance simultaneously. Then, Trey, Mike and Sofi Dillof 
taught the crowd how to do the dance. SOAM began as Also Sprach and was unfinished; the 
ensuing Kung launched into a dissonant jam.
