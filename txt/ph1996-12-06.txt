Show Notes:

Read Charlie Dirksens YEM review here: http://www.phish.net/reviews/yem/12-06-96.html

Most of Harpua features Les Claypool and Larry LaLonde from Primus. After the opening, Les does a rap about a weed, then more Harpua and the Jimmy story (Jimmy and Poster Nutbag going to Vegas). They stop and camp, where they start yodelling. John McEuen and Heather and Anamiekl August did a country/yodel tune.

The story continues with Jimmy & Poster meet up with four "Elvii" on the edge of Las Vegas and have a duel.  The four Elvis's sing the first few verses of "Suspicious Minds" and then Fish continues. Jimmy (Fish?) is victorious. Then the dog/cat fight. Harpua wins and the song finishes.

At some point everyone returns and then Brian Mantia, the drummer for Primus, shows up for "Suzy Greenberg". Everyone stays onstage for Suzy Greenberg, which includes a "Suzy-Q" jam.
