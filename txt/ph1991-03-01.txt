Set I Notes:
* Divided Sky contains a tease of Dave's Energy Guide by Trey and somewhat 

Mike (beginning at 9:38).

Thanks very much to Zac Rutter of Burlington for providing the analog cassette 
seed. It is a relatively low gen soundboard but there are some flaws: the soundcheck unsurprisingly has some level and channel flaws (and Llama has a 
cut); Wilson has channel/level flaws in the intro and first verses as well; Divided may have a minor phasing issue at one point, unless I imagined it; Page's piano solo in Coil is largely cut/missing (likely because of a tape flip at the show), and there's some minor tape warbling before the fade out; Tweezer's entire opening section is missing (perhaps also due to the tape flip); there are some very slight level issues here and there during the set, and there's a cut in Weekapaug. I also did not edit out the post-soundcheck, pre-first-set banter, even though it's nearly impossible to hear. There may be other flaws.

Set II Notes:
*Tape Flip(not much missing)
#WLL  is a few lyrics from Fishman and then a quick jam
