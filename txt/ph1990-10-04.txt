*Notes*
Faded the start of the cut opener and crossfaded the tape flip at the end of Tweezer/Magilla. Durring The Landlady, there is a dropout that was x-faded and there is some noise that can not be edited. In Destiny Unbound, there were a few pops from the instruments that were edited out. There is also what appears to be a very sudden pause in the tape durring Uncle Pen. Other than that, this show is absolutely amazing in sound quality. It still has some of the "tape" characteristics to it, but it just wouldn't sound right otherwise.
