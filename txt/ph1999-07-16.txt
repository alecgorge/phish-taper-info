Show Notes: Weekapaug included an Also Sprach tease. The encore was preceded by a 
story from Trey about how he and Page grew up "around here" in Jersey. Trey then referenced 
"the greatest songwriter of all time" and said that he, too, grew up in the area. While 
some in the crowd expected Bruce Springsteen (who was in the middle of a run of 15 sold-out 
dates at New Jersey's Continental Airlines Arena), Trey produced Tom Marshall. Tom appeared 
in the classic Born in the U.S.A. - era Springsteen outfit, complete with red bandana. He 
subsequently sang the debut of Born to Run. As the song concluded Tom mocked a bunch of 
Springsteen-esque arena-rock clichés, such as throwing his bandana into the crowd and jogging 
offstage to a handler who threw a towel around his shoulders. During the song he even aped 
some dance moves from the Dancing in the Dark video.
