Show Notes: After Acoustic Army, Trey thanked the crowd for being so quiet. The band then proceeded to don surgical masks for Adeline. The masks were provided by a fan in the front - Trey thanked him for the "hats." The encore was preceded by a Random Note Signal.

Tech Notes: Fades were added in soundforge 6.0. There was crowd noise missing between the second set and encore on my dat. I used a crossfade in soundforge to make the shift less abrubt.

Flaw Notes: There was a dropout in stash at 9:59.868 that I edited out using soundforge 6.0.
