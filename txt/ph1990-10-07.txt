This show as received had lots of flaws. There are missing sections 
between some songs I can't do anything about. Lots of tracks were cut 
wrong and were merged with CoolEdit then recut with CDWave. There's a 
major dropout in La Grange. The silent section is obviously the wrong 
length but I left that alone. There were various other smaller things 
that were done before running the whole thing through shntool to fix 
sector boundaries. I hope you enjoy the less than perfect results.
