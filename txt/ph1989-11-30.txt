About the transfer:  The beginning of both Bathtub and Reba were cut on the DAT, and presumably on the original Cass.  I did a little Cool Edit noise reduction to eliminate the hiss.  There's still a teeny bit of hiss because I didn't want to go overboard and interfere with the music.  Also, I cut a little crowd noise during Set 1 to fit it on one disc.

Enjoy!
