Show Notes: Fishman, introduced as "Flagina Fishman," took a vacuum solo during I Didn't 
Know wearing only stars and stripes boxers. Slave included a What's the Use tease and an 
instrumental Dark Star tease from Mike and Page. What's the Use subsequently debuted later 
in the set. Silent included a Little Drummer Boy tease. After Carini, the band reprised 
the chorus of Meatstick while part of the crew and a few fans did the Meatstick Dance. The 
band performed the encore in stars and stripes outfits and, afterwards, the sky was filled 
with fireworks. What's the Use debuted at this show, where Trey wore a Mia Hamm soccer 
jersey. FEFY was played for the first time since July 16, 1998 (55 shows) and Star Spangled 
Banner was played for the first time since December 2, 1997 (82 shows).
