*Mastering*
The Porter sources were just volume adjusted and had some slight EQ to try and lessen the Bass distortion. This source was used for Set 1 + part of Set 2 and the Bowie from Set 3.

The Redmond source:
RBass @ 35Hz +1db > BBE 0/1/0 > L1 > 192kHz ReSampler (48>44.1) > L1+ (24>16 Normal/Mode1/Digital) > SHNv3

The 2 sources were then run through a MetaNormalizer to equalize the volume between the 2 sources as closely as possible.

The Redmond source starts and ends at the * but was also used for the soundcheck.

Thanks to John Redmond and Josh Porter for the Cassettes.

Transfer notes:
I'm not sure about the song after Lizards. It does not seem to be a natural transition, but I can't find any evidence the tape was stopped and restarted and the crowd sounds the same. 

Notes:
This was my (Weave) and John Redomond's first show!! 

John received his copy of the end of Set 2 and Set 3 from Ben Hunter in late 88 or early 89. We are assuming it is Cass/1 since Hunter most likely made this copy of the master, but it is possible it is Cass/2, This is the only part of this show John has in his collection. This tape is missing the David Bowie found on Josh's tape and has the soundcheck instead.

Josh Porter provided a complete copy of this show and the soundcheck on 2 cassetes, the soundcheck, Set 1 and the beggining of Set 2 on one tape, and the end of Set 2 and Set 3 on the other. These tapes are of unknown (but low) gen. Redmonds copy of Set 2/3 is of much better quality.

This is the 1st time Phish played Boston. Molly's was located at the corner of Harvard and Brighton Aves in Allston. Very small bar, maybe 150-200 people. At that time Molly's was known for hosting Grateful Dead cover bands on Sunday nights.

NO tracking/editing/alterations performed before archiving to 24-bit FLAC
(except to trim silence from the ends).
