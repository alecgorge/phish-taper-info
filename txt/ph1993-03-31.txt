The original seed of this show did not include David Bowie.  I have
since found it and added it to the correct spot, the 1st track on
Disc 2.  This means that the rest of the tracks on Disc 2 had to be
moved up one slot and YEM -> Vocal Jam was moved to the beginning
of Disc 3 (which is probably where it belonged anyway).


This is a great show.  I sought it out for a long time after reading an
excellent review of the Hood.  Indeed you can definitely feel good about
this Hood, as well as the rest of the show.  As of now (11/2000) it seems
to me that it is rather underrated and not circulated much at all.  The
sound quality is EXCELLENT.  It is about as good as audience recordings
get.  If I didn't know better I might even think it was a SBD/AUD mix.

Some of these tracks had flaws which I corrected in Cool Edit 2000.  I am
pretty sure most circulating CDR copies of this show had these flaws
because I obtained the show from a different trader to be sure and it was
the same.  Here is a summary of what was done:

-Track 5 on Disc 1 (Mound) had three gaps of approximately 0.5 seconds each.  
These were at 4:58-9 and 5:08-9.  Removed.

-Track 1 on Disc 2 (Lengthwise) had some clicks and pops at 0:10-11, 0:30, and 
1:23-24.  These were removed or minimized to the best of my ability.

-Track 4 on Disc 3 (AC/DC Bag) had static at 3:35.  Removed.

Also the last track, Sweet Adeline, has quite a bit of hiss and is rather flaky 
overall.  It's really too much to fix, especially for an acapella track, so I 
decided to leave it as is.  Sounds like it is a different source and possibly 
more than one source patched together.
