Notes
The taper made level adjustments throughout the show.  The most jarring of these have been normalized relative to each other, and the rest left as is.

The master cassette was paused between Suzy Greenberg and Contact, suggesting that the band left stage and then returned for a second encore.  It was stopped again between Contact and Rocky Top, and started a few seconds late, which suggests that the taper was suprised when the band returned to stage a third time.  Trey comments during the show how much the band liked the venue, which may explain multiple encores and why, IMHO, they played so well this night.

NO tracking/editing/alterations performed before archiving to 24-bit FLAC
(except to trim silence from the ends).
