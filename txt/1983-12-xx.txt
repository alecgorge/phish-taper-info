Note: I recently was rummaging through some of my old dat tapes, and came across a tape 
that had the Space Antelope recording, which has circulated decently, as well as "this" 
recorded on it. I recall recently downloading a torrent that was labeled as an 
"Early and Rare 1983 demo", and which started off with a Jam from 12.25.83, followed by 
Slave, Antelope, and Hydrogen. Initially, I figured that whatever was on "this" dat that I 
had labeled as "Bivoauc Jaun", and was recieved in a trade a bunch of years ago during 
my hey day of recording and trading Phish shows on dat, was probably the same as the 
bit torrent I downloaded. However, after giving it a listen, I realized that it wasn't 
the exact 'same', but was 'similar', as it had the same Slave, Antelope, and Hydrogen that 
were a part of that 'demo'. Additionally, though, it had a bunch of other rare material, 
including early, partial renditions of The Divided Sky and Letter to Jimmy Page, 
as well as a few other 'songs' or 'jams' that I could not identify. Now, considering I 
recieved this in a trade from a phellow trader, there are certainly others out there that 
must have copies of this. Needless to say, though, I have never seen this seeded in its 
entirety. I suppose people may have refrained from circulating it under the assumption
that it wasn't worth it to do so, or that people may not want to hear it, as some of the 
jams/songs are a bit obscure. However, as a phan who appreciates listening to these early 
recordings and hearing where the band we all have grown to know and love came from, I am 
of the opinion that there has to be some peeps out there that would also appreciate 
hearing this. I mean, even if its just to give a listen to once, I think it is worth it to
just hear how wierd and funny it gets towards the end. So, in an effort to get this 
circulating, I figured I would transfer and seed it in as complete a form that I believe 
exists for all you who are phans of early and rare material. What I have included in this
text document I have done so to the best of my abilities and knowledge with information
included on my dat, as well as info obtain from "The Phish Companion" 'Discography Section'.
However, there are still a couple jams/songs that could not be identified due to a lack of
information, and for them I have filled in the blank as best as possible. 

Enjoy!!! 

Also, aside from adding some track markings, the integrity of the original recording (what
i have on dat) was kept in tact, and NO modifications or alterations were made in any way
after the original Remastering, which was not done by myself, and therefore I have no info
regarding what exactly was done. Overall, though, the recording sounds much better than you
might expect.
