- Lengthwise is missing from the SBD.
- Brief cut in I Didn't Know.
- Moments of static over the recording duration...not very bothersone, and mostly short lasting.
- *One of only 4 times it wasn't preceded by The Horse
- I Didn't Know was dedicated to the guy stuck on top of the Ferris Wheel. 
- Possum included a tease of LA Woman.
