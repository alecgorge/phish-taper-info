Notes: 
Diginoise on DAT in Foam @ 2:35 & 2:40....fixed by deletion of the offending samples. 
Fixed dropout in left channel in Bouncing @ 45:35....copied to mono for .10 seconds. 
Tape flip @1:41 in Divided Sky.....very fast and barely noticeable flip!! 
Micro-digizap @ 3:29 in Weekapaug....fixed!! 
Micro-digizap @ 6:40 in Possum.... 
I removed Memories & Adeline, as they were performed at the edge of the stage 
w/o mics. I was not able to boost the levels cleanly to preserve the music and remove 
the SBD buzz at the same time, so I chose to let them be something you had to be 
at the show to hear :-)
