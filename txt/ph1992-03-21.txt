notes: i know this show was recently seen on bt.etree.org, but that was
from a bootleg cd source thats circulated and is missing the encore. 

tapeflip was in the middle of weigh! :(  i was able to patch the 10 
seconds or so with the weigh from the 'wallops' cd source using cool edit pro2.
(thanks to bisq for upping the track to me) 

one of my favorite and best sounding shows of the club days, the let us
set up our gear right in front of the soundboard which was already pretty close
to the stage, but to the left of the room.  ENJOY!
