This is one of the more obscure items I have had in my collection. It was a filler on a tape I got from a Vermonter in the early to mid 1990's. Maybe it was the White Tape, or Bivouac Jaun, I'm not sure. I used to look for old and rare recordings back then. Back when rare meant rare and you hand wrote tapes lists to send via snail mail. Some of you might not know that music was traded on cassettes back then ;) I have never seen any info about this nor have I stumbled onto anyone else who has this little gem. I decided to put it online for a couple reasons. I figured some people might enjoy it for one. More inportantly I was hoping to find an upgrade or prompt others to post some gems that are as rare as this. Some of you might not have even ever heard this tune, or heard of it. It was played very little in the very beginnings of Phishs career. This must be a four track home recording. I also know there were different version recorded of the same song. 

So if you have any info PLEASE hit me up at cleantone hotmail com to let me know. Keven? I would also appreciate an upgrade, or maybe share some other very rare recordings with me. Thanks in advance and enjoy!
