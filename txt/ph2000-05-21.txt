Show Notes: Seek out the second set for some interesting stage banter. Page 
talked about how he had often visited Radio City as a child, while Trey talked 
again about how much the band appreciates the fan support. Zero included a Who 
Knows tease and Disease included Llama teases and a Crosseyed and Painless-type groove.
