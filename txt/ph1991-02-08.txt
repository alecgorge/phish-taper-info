-Notes-
* severe level problems during first few minutes. This part, sadly had to be removed. From the point where the audio went clear again is where it is faded in from.
** With Carl Gerhard
// - indicates there was a tape flip with some music loss.
There are parts durring the show where the mix gets a little off, and sometimes Mike is turned up a little too much causing a slight distortion on the bass. I don't think it takes away from the recording too much.

**Mastering Notes**
-Squirming Coil static at 2'40'' and 2'45'' (sounds like the cable was pulled or twisted) 

-Mango static at 5'01'' (same noiseprint as the static in Coil) 

Bouncin some tape thingy at 1'17'' (this sounds like a plug wiggle/twist that caused one part of the plug to dropout the signal real fast from R>L) 

**I did try to correct these errors....the errors ended up being much more desireable than the processed corrections.
