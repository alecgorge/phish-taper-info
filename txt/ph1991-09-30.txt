Note from Doug Nawrocki:
- At the fade in following Sparkle, it sounds like they are ending Take The A-Train; only the final seconds of that tune are in tact.
- Fishman leads the crowd in Happy Birthday to Trey. At the end of Love You he wishes another Happy Birthday to Trey and says "There's enough for everyone. So, after the show, c'mon up and grab a piece of the snowball."


Original Notes:
- no noise reduction or eq done, tracks were normalized
- ... fade in done at beginning of Lizards due to tape flip, slight volume increase in middle of song.
# fade out (Sparkle, Landlady) where tape flips
- * at very beginning of Possum, somebody comments :  "hold on to it, I think it's the only one here" referring to the boombox recording - no one else recorded the show that night.

---- one final note ------  Mark estimates there was "maybe" 150 people in
attendance at the show that night.
