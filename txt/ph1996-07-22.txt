Phish opened for Santana. 

* the song fades in...not much of the beginning chords are lost. There are also some adjustments/rumble as the taper gets situated.
** there is a cut in the middle at 00:47:10.23 > 00:47:11.67 ...durring the WUDMTF part...this could not be repaired and was left as-is
^ this is where the distortion/dropouts get really bad....I did my best to edit them, but some are still audible

*NOTE*
This is not the best sounding show, but it is all we have and is being released for those who must have every show......There were numerous areas of dropouts/distortion in the entire show. I tried my best to remove all the really bad ones, but a few (minor) areas still remain.
