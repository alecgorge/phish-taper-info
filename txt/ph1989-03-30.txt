Show Notes:
This show marked Chris Kuroda's first full show as light technician and included the first known versions of The Mango Song and Undun.

#tape flip - songs joined with Cool Edit Pro--->{Some of these were re-edited to make the flips/cuts more seamless.}
*errors - sounds like either the master had a skip, or there was a buffer underrun durring the transfer.
