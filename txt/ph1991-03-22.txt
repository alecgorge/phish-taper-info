-NOTES-
* This show comes from an unknown analog generation cassette. There are times where the age of the tape is really prevalent. There is also some very noticable wow and flutter at times in set 1. Set 2 is much cleaner, and I do believe it to be a cassette closer to the master than set 1. There are PA problems at the start of the show, it sounds like the left channel blew out....still, this is all we got for now till the master DAT's surface.

Thanks to LawnGirl for helping verify the setlist and for REALLY wanting this show....
