**note**:
this is the only source of this show in existance (as of 12/12/02)  this show 
was not thought to exist.  the almanac, companion, and even kevin shapiro 
didn't even have a setlist!.  i was given the tape from the taper, and sent 
it to kevin to be transfered, have the pitch fixed, and put a copy in the 
phish archives.  the show is incomplete, and the sound is TERRIBLE!!!! a real 
hard listen, never the less, it's the only source around.  only recommended 
for the person who "has to have every show"  :)   (steve szaks, 12/12/02)
