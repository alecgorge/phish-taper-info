* - Debuts
** - contains My Girl tease and alternate lyrics "Water your team in a beehive, I'm a sent you".  
This happened due to Mike's response in a previous Döniac Schvice when someone asked "What are the lyrics in You Enjoy Myself?" posted to Mike's Corner.
*** - Dedicated to Sarah who was taking care of Marley because he was "too old and fat to come on tour anymore."
**** - Spliced in from a master cassette audience source.

I received this show as thanks from Kevin Shapiro for filling a void in the Phish archives, Wetlands 6/9/90 that many of you have been enjoying.
It appears that there was an analog deck in the beginning of this chain since there are short drop-outs (due to tape flips) at the end of I Didn't Know
and in the middle of YEM.  There is no hiss whatsoever on this source, so it definitely was recorded to a digital media.
Kevin used the master cassette audience source to smooth out the transition between Divided Sky and I Didn't Know.
I fused together the cut in YEM using Sound Forge 6.0 at 12:07.  Kevin also supplied the fillers which sound like MCS or CS1 sources.

A HUGE THANK YOU to Kevin Shapiro for hooking me up with my first show : )
