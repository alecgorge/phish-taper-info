Notes on Conversion:  this is a re-seed.  Donswank's original conversion was with the
Zefiro ZA-2 soundcard, which yielded inferior results compared to this fileset. Regardless, 
there is a quick drop of levels around the 14-minute mark of set I, during AC/DC Bag (just before
"Braindead...and made of money...), but nothing to worry about. This flaw is also on my DAT.
Maybe the band will get with it and release this show as part of the LivePhish series. 
I hope you enjoy the music. This show marked my first AC/DC Bag, which is among my top  
favorite phish songs...when played right.  Please join WWW.SHNS.NET
