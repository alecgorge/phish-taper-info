Source - FOB Schoeps/DAT, rig details unknown. 
Transfer - DAT clone-> optical-> HHb CDR830 Standalone burner-> EAC/WAV-> FLAC

Notes: 
- On the transfer from DAT to CDR I boosted the levels of the right channel ~4db... 
- There are tiny glitches, or skips (?) in both Bouncin' and Stash (once each per song). 
  I don't know what the deal is with those but they are present on the DAT. 
  It sounds kind of like the deck was paused then started again a split second later, 
  making it sound "spliced."   
- from phish.net hfb entry for this show: The band that was to follow Phish on an adjacent 
  stage was soundchecking during Phish's set; this interfered significantly at times.
