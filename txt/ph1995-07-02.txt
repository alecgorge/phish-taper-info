show notes:
This was a benefit show for the King Street Youth Center.
The band brought back Camel Walk, which hadn't been played since February 24, 1989 (648 shows).

technical notes:
on the DAT, there were two very minor drop-outs, and there was a cut in the encore break
The drop-outs were at the following locations:
in Julius [06:38.2] to [06:38.6]
in encore break [00:05.5] to [00:05.6]

the drop-out in Julius was patched with the circulating B&K 4011 source:
http://db.etree.org/shn/616

the drop-out and the cut in the encore break were left as-is,
because they are so minor and do not affect any of the music.
