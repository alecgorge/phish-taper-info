Show Notes: Fire was played for the first time since October 13, 1994 (69 shows).

Tech Notes: I extracted the cds as a range and resplit the tracks using CDWAV. The EAC logs for each disc are included.  I added fades at the beginning and end of the sets in soundforge. Shntool was also run to remove SBE's.  
This show contains a fair amount of boom that can be fixed with an eq somewhat.  I haven't found an eq that can get rid of the chatty (and often yelling and screaming) crowd near the taper however.
