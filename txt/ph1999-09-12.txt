* Tiny flash of diginoise during the opening "loops" of the song. Levels slightly hot for first few mins.

I transferred this to SHN several years ago, but never circulated it. I think it's a fantastic sounding recording of a great
show (especially for 1999!). I moved the encore to the end of D1 to maintain the continuity of the 2nd set, but you could
also place it onto a 3rd disc if you prefer.

Enjoy!
