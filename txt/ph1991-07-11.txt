Show Notes: The entire show, which was a free show, featured The Giant Country Horns. 
This show marked the first performance of Touch Me. Frankenstein was played for 
the first time since December 3, 1989 (160 shows) and Flat Fee was played for 
the first time since September 13, 1988 (230 shows).

note: altho the exact lineage is a little foggy, i believe this to be a 
straight digital source and not from a master cassette like many of the 
earlier sbd's. Enjoy!
