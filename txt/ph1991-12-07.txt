NOTES:
This show is a great one that has been missing for far too long. All circulating sources were from a SBD>cass4>DAT, and this is a cass/x off that.....so as you can imagine, not the greatest sound.....but, amazingly it's still very listenable. The tape cuts right after they give the tramps away. What you are getting here is the straight transfer from the tape, no fancy mastering or restoration was done. The only processing was converting from 24/48 > 16/44.1 which was done with Wavelab with the Apogee UV22HR and the 192k resampler respectively.
