Show Notes: Ginseng Sullivan debuted in the first set with Trey on acoustic, Fish on 
washboard, Page on piano, and Mike on bass. Sweet Adeline was performed without 
microphones. My Sweet One and Antelope each contained multiple Simpsons Signals, and 
My Sweet One also contained a Fingerscrape Signal and Oom Pa Pa Signal. Mike teased 
the Jeopardy theme on bass during Antelope, which also has a tease of A Love Supreme. 
Great Gig featured a Fishman vacuum solo. Fishman quoted the vocals of Games Without 
Frontiers during Mike's Song. Bold as Love was played for the first time since 
February 26, 1993 (73 shows).
