This show was a dream to work on. Not only was it a super clean recording, the music is VERY hot. The only funky things I think I need to warn you of are the crossfades for the tape flips. This show reminded me the entire time I was working on it the reason why I love the music these four guys are capable of making....This show will blow ya away!

-Notes-
*-dedicated to Conjunction Junction for being the only other band Trey knows that can play this song....he then also dedicates it to his parents who were in attendance this night.

**-Trey stops Good Times Bad Times in the middle and says "That wasn't meant to be so we'll give you this instead", then they bust into BBFCFM.

NO tracking/editing/alterations performed before archiving to 24-bit FLAC
