Show Notes: Ya Mar was much longer than usual and was unfinished. This unusual Mike's Song featured 
some memorable vocal interplay from the band that included a chant to "Bring the Dude." It also 
included Foxy Lady quotes from Fishman and a Funky Town tease. During Hood, Trey asked Chris Kuroda 
to turn off the lights for a Blackout Jam, and the audience responded with a shower of green glow 
sticks. Catapult was played for the first time since March 2, 1997 (60 shows).
