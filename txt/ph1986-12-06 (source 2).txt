Notes: This show came to me in a random trade claiming to be the lost
Jazz Odyssey sets from 7/30/88. The setlist didn't match, and it sat
unlabeled as "Phish - 1986???" for a while, until the text file for
the other two sets popped up with Kevin Shapiro's notes, and it was
properly identified as the first set to 12/6/86.
I have no idea what gen the cassette was.
All I did with Audacity was boosted the levels a little bit.
This has not circulated on disc before, and it almost completes 
Kevin's setlist when combined with what already circulates.
Any questions, feel free to email me at taperwayne@yahoo.com
Enjoy!
