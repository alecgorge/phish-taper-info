Show Notes: Dog Gone Dog (first since November 27, 1998, or 68 shows) was dedicated to Paul Languedoc. 
Afterwards, the band reprised the song for a few seconds after Trey remarked how much he liked it. 
Also, Buffalo Bill was played for the first time since the same November 27, 1998 show. ASZ 
included Do You Feel Like We Do (Peter Frampton) teases (possibly as a nod to the play on words in 
the Hampton Comes Alive title upon the band's return to the venue) and Weekapaug included a Norwegian 
Wood tease and a Buffalo Bill tease. 
--------------------
Notes:

Just a note on the source, the taper sat behind the stage on the lower level and
taped from his seat.  I think he has taped from this spot before, but this is
the only tape I've heard from this spot - hopefully other sources like this will emerge!  

And maybe I'm deaf or wasn't paying attention, but I don't hear a drop out in Sand
like on the previous version of this set...  

Thanks to Steve for providing the DATs!

Thanks to Jason Sobel for pointing out my error in the first set, I had my NJB3
recording at 48, when it should have been 44.1.  Please destroy the old seed and
replace with this new seed.
