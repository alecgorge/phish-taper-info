Mastering Notes: X-Noise was used to remove the noise floor and the 
24/48 WAVs were assembled in the Wavelab Audio Montage window, 
crossfades were made at tapeflips.  A Level adjustment during Landlady 
was compensated for.  It sounded like tape was stopped between the 
final section of Reba and the reprise, as well as Tube & Tweezer, I 
edited out some silence and performed crossfades. 3dB was added to 
compensate for an overall level change from Paul & Silas thru Magilla.  
The following mastering processes were applied: X-Noise, Waves REQ 
(2-band, top secret settings), Blue Tubes FA770, BBE Sonic Maximizer 
(2, 2, unity), Blue Tubes LM2S limiter.  The resulting .WAV was tracked 
in CD-WAV and converted to SHNv3 (seek tables appended).
