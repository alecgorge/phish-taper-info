?	With “Can’t Turn you Loose” Jam to end Stash

Show Notes: Stash included Can't Turn You Loose and Happy Birthday (to Trey) teases. 
After Stash, Trey announced a contest where the winner would receive four tickets 
and backstage passes to any show in the next year and, jokingly, a date with Fishman. 
The question centered on what all of the songs played in the first set, with the 
exception of Driver, had in common. The answer was that all songs were in the Key of D.
 Cities was an appropriate choice as an encore for Memphis, and Trey altered the 
lyrics a bit for the occasion. Mike's included a Who Knows tease.
