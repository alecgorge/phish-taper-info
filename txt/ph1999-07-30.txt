Show Notes: Before Bike, Fishman told the crowd that he would play guitar instead 
of vacuum because the Electrolux vacuum did not make the trip to Japan. Afterwards, 
Trey said that the song was meant to impress Yoshimi, the drummer from The Boredoms, 
because Fishman has "a crush on her."


-there is a short cut in ghost and cavern where the analog tape flip occurred. 
-there is some SBD static at the beginning of Birds. This was on the original DAT.
