	There was digi-noise in both Sparkle and Sample present on my DAT.  In Sparkle I was able to copy the right channel over the digi-noise in the left channel.  Sample was quite a bit more nasty.  Through a combination of channel copying individual samples, WaveLab's pencil tool and a few sample deletions I was able to get the track into it's present form.  It's still not perfect (you can expect some problems from about 2:57 to 3:10), but it's a pretty good improvement and much more listenable especially in comparison to the original.  If you're curious how the track was before I worked on it, check out http://www.ontheflyrecording.com/samples/ph1993-02-2d2t05.mp3
