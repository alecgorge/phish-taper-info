Phish
2-14-91
The State Theatre
Ithaca, NY

Set 1 complete except My Sweet One; set 2 partial.

Source: unknown, likely an SBD/AUD matrix created by Paul, since it sounds like a matrix and according to a comment
on the phish.net setlist for this date, written by scott (Rumpofsteelskin):
"We have the soundboard of this show, but Paul only let my friends Terry and Bryan patch in for the first set as he
wanted to test a Matrix Aud/SBD feed. Second set board we do not have."

This audio has been extracted (without re-encoding) from a video of the show. I have no further lineage information.
