**NOTES**
There was a tape flip between Lizards and A-Train...the start of A-Train was cut, so the files were crossfaded. There is a short pause at the start of The Lizards. The levels were adjusted by using the L3 MultiMaximizer and to also limit sub-bands to squeeze the most db's out of the recording without introducing distortion.
