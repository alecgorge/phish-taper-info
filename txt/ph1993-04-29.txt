-Big thanks to Kevin and Mark for transfer help, and to Kevin and Phil Joubert for providing the
source recordings!


Notes:
This show comes from multiple sources because the best copy (Kevin's source) did not have a
second set available.  Phil provided a complete copy of the Sennheiser>Cass1 source, with the
SBD soundcheck as filler, but I decided to only use the second set because this would give us
the best possible copy of both sets.  There IS a complete SBD copy of the show known to circulate
in analog, but I have yet to find a digital copy, and most analog copies we have heard are hissy.
The My Friend encore is not on this show because there was only about 1 minute of the song on the masters 
of the recording. I decided not to include this minute because it's not even the complete intro
to the song.

Flaws and Edits:
-Short cut before Fee from a cassette flip in the patch chain. No music was affected.
-Level adjust at 4:02 of Mike's
-Master cassette flip at 5:42.5 of Mike's. Edited out as best as possible, but there is an
obvious change in the high end of the recording after the flip.
-Light hiss reduction performed on the soundcheck using Cool Edit Pro.

Show Notes: Some of the fans cheered the mention of Quebec during Fee. 
Antelope included a brief jam on Pink Floyd's Money. Ya Mar contained 
some funny stage banter, as Trey tried to bring "Leo" in too early. 
It also included a Can't Turn You Loose tease from Page. Hydrogen included 
a tease of I've Got Spurs That Jingle Jangle Jingle, with a bassline somewhat 
akin to Happy Trails. Weekapaug included a Can't You Hear Me Knockin' tease 
from Page. Fishman dedicated Terrapin to his friends from Burlington who made 
the trip to see the band. Makisupa was played for the first time since 
November 26, 1990 (307 shows).
