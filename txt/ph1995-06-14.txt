Show Notes: The highlight of this show was a massive, long (almost 50 minutes!), jammed out 
Tweezer that included a brief Gypsy Queen jam, an Also Sprach tease, a Slave-like jam, and a 
Digital Delay Loop Jam with whistling. Simple was performed with an a cappella ending instead 
of a jam, akin to the ALO version from December 8, 1994. Amazing Grace was performed without 
microphones. Listen for a Stairway to Heaven tease at the start of the first set.

Tech Notes:  Fades were added in soundforge 6.0 . I used a really quick fade at the beginning of set II because the music cut in immediately on my dat and I wanted to preserve as much as possible. There was also crowd noise missing between the second set and encore on my dat so I left it as is.

Amazing Grace is performed without amplification so it is barely audible on the DAT.
