this show is in low circulation.  good show from a good tour.

this has been circulated on analog, though very little.  there is also a
sbd2>cdr version of set 1 that circulates, though if is mastered too fast.

although this is by no means a perfect recording, this is the best circulating.

perhaps due to this, a better copy will appear, along eith the 5-5-92 bogarts show.

*  rift is from an unknown source, cuts in at the "last night" vocals.

rift was cut from the dat copy, so is replaced here from an 
unknown analog audience source.
