Phish.Net Notes:
Taped for Y100's Sonic Sessions feature. Approximately 50 people were in attendance. 
The same day, portions of the show were also played on WXPN's "World Cafe" program. 
*Audience did the "wooo!" from the lyrics, thus making Trey laugh. 
**Trey goofed up twice, and said "that's why we're in a recording studio; we can 
do this all over again."
