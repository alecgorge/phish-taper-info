Show Notes: In keeping with the theme of the second set, Hood included a Moby Dick tease. 
During Terrapin (first since July 8, 1999, or 82 shows), Fishman was introduced as actor 
Russell Crowe. The Moby Dick inside of the HYHU jam featured Trey on drums and Fishman on 
vacuum. The Chalkdust Reprise was akin to the version last played on 
December 10, 1994 (387 shows), with the band singing the words "Chalk Dust Torture" over 
varied music. At the end of the encore, Trey joked that, if anyone missed anything, they 
should read the book or see the movie. Prior to this show, Moby Dick had not been played 
since November 29, 1997 (168 shows).

Edits and mix performed on DoomTooth by shakedown@furthurnet.org

All edits and mixes were performed in Steinberg's WaveLab and Cubase SX.
Various Waves plug-ins were also used.  Some FM-interference was removed 
with Cool Edit Pro.

Sections of 2001 on the ALD-FM contained almost no music, just FM-interference.
The AUD source was used as a patch for these sections while maitaining the 
same audio processing. There are other somewhat noticeable instances of FM 
static, but nothing major, and not during signifigant sections of the music.

I recieved the FM/ALD source in a trade almost a year ago, and only listened to
sections of it as a result of the FM-interference, I hope you consider this copy
worthy of listening all the way through.
