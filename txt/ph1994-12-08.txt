Phish
12-08-94 MIX
Spreckels Theatre
San Diego, CA

As the 'm' indicates, this is a MIX of two sources:

-- THE DSBD --
Source:
DSBD > Master DAT > My first-generation DAT clone (Taped by
Mr. Anonymous)

Transfer:

My DAT (First Gen Clone) > Fostex D5 > optical cable > HOSA
ODL-276 >
coax cable > Waveterminal 2496, hardware downsampling to
44.1KHz on
Set I only (Set II was apparently recorded at 44.1) >
CoolEdit 2000 Static removal & other fixes > CDWave 1.6 > WAV
>
mkwACT 0.97b1 > SHN v3  (By Jeff Ishaq )

Scarcity:
Mr. Anonymous's DSBD DATs are widely circulated, though
because they are
unauthorized, they don't show up on etree and some traders don't
indicate
the show on their list.  Some copies have noise reduction
performed on
them, I'm sure.


Notes:
* The master DAT is plagued by constant, light static throughout
the entire
show -- IMHO, it's unlistenable.  Also, it is missing the  first song.
I
used Cool Edit 2000 to remove 99.9% of the static clicks, and I
also
integrated Makisupa, Nellie Cane, and Sweet Adeline from the
FOB AUD.  The
sound quality of the original DSBD DAT is identical to the click-
removed
version, it's not like it was compressed or lost high end or has
phase
shifting or anything nastly like that!

* I produced this mix to liberate the DSBD source into a
continuous,
listenable source for my own collection.  I don't intend this to be
the
de facto "best source" for this show.  In fact, the FOB AUD in wide
circulation sounds just as good as the DSBD, and it's unadultered.
I only
recommend this show for the sake of archival purposes.

-- THE AUD --
Source:
FOB AKG460 (13 Ft. pole, front row, center-right {12-7}, center-left
{12-8})
> 10' XLR > PS > 3' XLRs > Technics SV260A > DAT (Taped by
Linda Webster)

Transfer:
Technics SV260A > COAX > Cool Edit WAV (editing done here) >
CDWAV >
mkwACT v3 > SHN (By Linda Webster)

Scarcity:
Linda's AUD source is widly available via etree.

Notes:
* This FOB AUD sounds as good as the DSBD, so if you're a purist
looking
for an unadultered show, seek these out!
* Linda used Cool Edit to make the acoustic/a capella songs
louder, and to
stifle audience noise.
-- END OF AUD NOTES --


Flaws / Mixing Notes:
* There are still some very infrequent and quiet static pops the
linger (I was
only able to remove 99.9% of them!).  Also, some mild saturation
occurs in
loud passages that sounds like static.
