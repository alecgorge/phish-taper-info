Anomolies:
There is a quick patch of the left channel with the right in during the fade-in to Landlady.  It sounds like John stopped the tape at a false-start ending in Gumbo and quickly hit REC again - thankfully he did, because we get to hear the David Bowie-style ending to a very oldschool Gumbo.
