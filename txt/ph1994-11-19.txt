This is the first time i've heard this, but thousands have ask me
about it over the years. To me it captures the true spirit of Phish.
It happened as we were walking to the bus to leave the venue. somebody
said play us one and we said sure and the roadies got our stuff. i was
already holding my banjo which probably started the whole thing. I was
on tour with them to teach them bluegrass and had been playing with
them on stage some at night. Hoist was being released at the time and
i actually played with them on that material at night as well as the
bgrass set. though they really didn't know bgrass and had just been
playing for a short while, this truly captured the spirit of the music
because of their openess, talent, and what i call that "wonderful
phish curiosity". i was touched to hear this because when you boil it
all down this is what it's all about. the people just want to hear the
music and truly i didn't wanna leave. you can hear the joy. i lead the
jam as phish had never really done that before. when we got on the bus
they were so happy that we did it and i think they felt, maybe for the
first time,the true spirit of what bgrass and folk music is all about.
the jam turned out to be the most important thing that i taught them.
thanks for sharing it. i am touched.

Truly,
"rev" Jeff Mosier
