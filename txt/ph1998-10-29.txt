*After "Limb by Limb," Trey talked about how Fish played the old ending much 
better than the new one, so he told Fish to play the old one. Fish then started 
the old ending, but stopped after to figure out where to start. He tried
again, but stopped once more. Then he figured it out and started with the cymbal
work and vocal refrains until the end of the song. Trey then thanked Fish, and Fish
took a bow. **Trey on acoustic guitar.
