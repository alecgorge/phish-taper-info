Tech Notes:
You are getting this show as it appears on the tape. No mastering was performed to improve quality....there was just too much wild shit going on with the tape due to its age/condition to warrant any "real" mastering. After the tape flip, the beginning of Oh Kee Pa was destroyed...I x-faded this as best as possible...the tape was basically rotting off the backing layer, getting jammed up in my tape path. This was a one shot deal...so what you are getting here is a pure representation of what was on the tape....the only processing done was the resampling and wordlength reductions.
