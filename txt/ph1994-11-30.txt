EDITING NOTES
========================
The following edits were performed using Sound Forge 4.5g:
 1. Resampled to 44.1 kHz at the best quality setting.  Anti-alias filter was applied to minimize noise.
 2. Normalized to 0.0 db peak value with anti-alias filter applied.
 3. Removed a dropout which occurs during the crowd noise at the end of d1t6
 4. Removed a dropout which occured during the crowd noise at the end of d1t8; five second cross-fade was applied to mask volume change.
 5. Boosted volume of d2t12 (acapella, no mics).  Before the edit this track could barely be heard even at high volumes.  I applied fades at the beginning and end to minimize the effect of the volume changes.  

Known flaw: d2t03 (MSO) has a brief "blip" at 1:16.  

Unedited versions of tracks d1t6, d1t8, & d2t12 are included for purists, but I believe the edited tracks are preferable for optimum listening pleasure and to maintain the live experience.  Every effort was made to make the edits unnoticable to the listener.  I believe I succeeded in this goal, but you can be the judge of that yourself!
