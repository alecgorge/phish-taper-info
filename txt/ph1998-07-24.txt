*After Page finishes a lengthy and beautiful piano solo, 
Trey begins his part of the "muel duel" by playing a nice classical riff 
(20 seconds or so). He then pauses and plays a few heavy metal licks 
that then go into "Ha Ha Ha" (the band follows). 
**After "Ha Ha Ha," Trey does a bit more of his guitar solo, 
which is followed by the "Russian" dance segment.
